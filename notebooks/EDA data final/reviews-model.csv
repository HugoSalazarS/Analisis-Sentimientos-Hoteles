A horrible welcome, there were 2 ladies among them, one was Latin but to bother her she spoke in English, to tell us to pay an additional 250 dollars for guarantee and credit card, that they do not accept cash, which was never in their guidelines, their The solution was to look for another hotel and understand me with the application to return my money (the lodging was already paid in advance), in the end we managed to solve that problem with a deposit that they made from Peru, they never cleaned on the days of the lodging When I ask the one who speaks Spanish in how many days they will return the 250 dollar guarantee, she responds in a bad way, that depends on your bank....

Sometimes job duties shift and plans change for work.  I reached out to Southwest (through which I booked the room) and they in turn reached to Hyatt.  Even though they were notified four days before my arrival about the cancellation, Southwest was advised today they wouldn't refund the money for a room.  This is totally unacceptable when I didn't wait until the day or even 24 hours but gave plenty of notice.  In addition, it proves they are flexible to loyal customers as well.  In the past 5 months, I have stayed there at least 3 times and it is frequently booked by several other state employees that travel to the Houston area.

Went to speak to manager, Farrah, downstairs and explained everything to her. She was very attentive to our needs and made me feel like she cared and I'm sure she did. She said she would submit us for 8,000 points for our inconvenience and told engineer would check our room tomorrow morning.

20504,1520,18489,2023-06-24,"Potential guests of this hotel,

We stayed at this hotel last week. We were stranded in Houston due to weather. We were sold a room by an Wyndham representative who was not on site. When we got to the hotel around 930pm there was no power. The night clerk could not get anyone into any rooms as the electronic keys were non functional. The hotel had no backup power or any means to access any locked rooms on the property.  Power did not come on until 2am. However, the night clerk was unable to access the internet so all of the stranded guests remained stranded in the lobby until 530am.

Of course we did not blame the night staff for the weather or electrical circumstances which caused so many to be put in uncomfortable situations. I do think the hotel (and perhaps others) were unprepared for the situation.

The many guests stranded at the hotel were given no support other than bottled water. The hotel did not offer the many stranded travelers blankets, pillows, and or roll away beds to ease comfort. Furthermore, the manager began charging fatigued guests for a night in the hotel lobby $80 per room to stay from 530am until check out.
$80 was a discounted rate ($30 off the original price). However, the discount at this point was a slap in the face. Especially for guests who clearly don’t have an alternative. We had an infant child. Furthermore, most guests arrived after the power was out, being directed to the hotel by a central office representative who hopefully had no idea that the power was out at the location.

As the heat waves seem to cause rolling blackouts, which may be a regular occurrence, I would suggest installing a backup method (generator/key entrance)for gaining entrance to your rooms. Training staff in how to respond to these situation would also seem wise. Having no solution is clearly a problematic scenario for both your staff and guests.

Every guest who experienced this situation was astonished at the least at the lack of response capabilities/tools and empathy at your staffs’ disposal. One staff did not know how to turn lights off so that people could attempt to sleep. The other staff member stated he could not get the manager on the phone and had no idea how to resolve internet, computer, and power issues.

This has been my worst hotel experience in memory. The response and trying to excuse the ineptitude with which the situation was handled,  the attitude and communication in dealing with fatigued guests trying to check in after a night of no sleep was inappropriate.

I hope for the sake of your future guests that you take some action to improve your performance and capacity for addressing extenuating circumstances.",1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0.8603,potential guest hotel stay hotel last week strand houston due weather sell room wyndham representative site get hotel around 930pm power night clerk could get anyone room electronic key non functional hotel backup power mean access locked room property power come 2 am however night clerk unable access internet strand guest remain strand lobby 530am course blame night staff weather electrical circumstance cause many put uncomfortable situation think hotel perhaps other unprepared situation many guest strand hotel give support bottled water hotel offer many strand traveler blanket pillow roll away bed ease comfort furthermore manager begin charge fatigued guest night hotel lobby 80 per room stay 530am check 80 discount rate 30 original price however discount point slap face especially guest clearly do not alternative infant child furthermore guest arrive power direct hotel central office representative hopefully idea power location heat wave seem cause rolling blackout may regular occurrence would suggest instal backup method generatorkey entrancefor gain entrance room training staff respond situation would also seem wise solution clearly problematic scenario staff guest every guest experience situation astonish least lack response capabilitiestool empathy staff disposal one staff know turn light people could attempt sleep staff member state could get manager phone idea resolve internet computer power issue bad hotel experience memory response try excuse ineptitude situation handle attitude communication deal fatigue guest try check night sleep inappropriate hope sake future guest take action improve performance capacity address extenuate circumstance

I narrowed my choices down to Sunset Tower, Andaz, and Mondrian and due to favorable reviews, I chose Sunset Tower Hotel and moving forward, this will be my choice hotel when visiting LA.

All of those factors solidified my feeling that I had chosen the right hotel,
While some hotels might be more modern, the rooms at sunset, are very nice, cozy and styled more traditionally which is indicative of the culture and glam associated with this hotel. The sunset hotel screams old status versus many others on the block and when you have a hotel on this level, the clientele is a bit more elegant and mature, the employees are usually more seasoned and it seems the turnover is very low if at all.
While every employee was fantastic the ones that stood out the most were Eva (front desk) and Angel (Tower Bar). While waiting for my friend, I complimented Eva on her accent and I found out she is from Kenya. We had a lovely, genuine conversation and her smile was always so beautiful.

We propped the bathroom door open because the exhaust fan was in there to just try and circulate some of the smell.
Add to that their accounting system where the computer randomly put additional holds totally over 3k on our credit card and the staff could do or would do nothing about it. Those holds stayed there for a week. When you are traveling cross country for a month and have a budget that is a problem.

This was our 2nd time staying with you.  I understand that you probably have a labor shortage, but I asked TWICE for two towels and the front desk said that they would sent them right up.  That never happened.  I loved our room but the TV remote was sticky & obviously not cleaned.

It was over 90 degrees and humid outside which made the room about 80 degrees. It was not fixed until the next afternoon after multiple attempts to get a different room and then being told that their system was down. After it was finally fixed, the room did not get cooled down for a few hours. The bed was broken, the shower had no pressure, the wifi didn't work and there was another guest that entered our room with a different room key. Once the system was back up and running we were not offered a new room even though we asked for one.
We went to the front desk about these issues many different times and the only thing that was done is we were not charged for the resort fee. We were given the manager's card and have been trying to contact him for over a month now via phone and email and there has been no response.

We arrived from Chicago to New York, with a Lollapalooza in between and the experience from the first minute at the Hotel was fabulous. When we checked in, they gave us a higher-ranking room and things to snack on, because we had stipulated that we were coming on our honeymoon. Fantastic move by the hotel.

The breakfasts were very simple, but not bad. You have the option to sit down and pay $5 per person, or grab your food and eat elsewhere. We tried Bacon, Egg & Cheese, Yoghurt with Granola, Fruit, Coffee and Orange Juice. All very good.

During the stay, some orders were arriving at the hotel in my name, where the hotel staff was very effective when coordinating the deliveries. Very good service.

On the floors there is a water and ice dispenser, in case we needed to refill bottles for long walks around the city. Very good.

The people who make the pieces, very nice. Those who attend upon arrival, very professional.

The only detail was that when we checked in we had to deposit approximately $300 for taxes or charges, and we understood that this amount was a kind of guarantee and returned to our accounts. But it didn't happen. It wasn't that desperate either. It did not cause any major inconvenience.

We would go back to the hotel anyway, which of course has an extraordinary location to move to any sector of Manhattan.

This hotel is an absolute disaster customer service wise, it is clear they are disorganised and poorly trained. There is no point in emailing them as the 'management' do not respond to emails and when calling you are told that there is no manager available or they simply do not pick up the phone. The staff here are simply unwilling to help customers.

Beginning on July 21st I have been calling this hotel asking to speak to a manager, I was told ‘there is no manager on duty until Monday’. Nevertheless, I continued to call and email over the next few days to be treated rudely. I was placed on holds, hung up on, had to call from multiple numbers as they would stop picking up from my number. At one point, I was told I would need to call at 10:30 PM on a Friday night to speak to a manager which is weirdly unprofessional, I have never heard of a hotel operating like this. I did call on that Friday night to be told again the manager was actually not coming in until 11:30 PM, when I called then I was told ‘there are 100 people checking in nobody can speak to you right now’. I have just tried to call again today during normal operating hours and was, once again, rudely told that the manager ‘Carry’ was unable to come to the phone and had this person relay a message. I have dealt with many hotels in my life, and have never witnessed such a high level or disorganisation and unprofessionalism. There is definitely a staffing/training problem that headquarters should be aware of.

Well our room key wouldn't work, called the front desk and they brought up another key but that didn't work either. It turns out it was the actual door lock and maintenance had to let us in. The maintenance guy said they would fix it while we were out for the day the next day, which they did and were thankful for bc after a long day of walking around Disney we were more than ready to get showers and go to bed. The fold down bench in the shower had loose screws and it was tricky to get it to stay together when folding it up and down. I will say the water pressure was excellent bc the hand shower fell and sprayed water all over the bathroom floor. I had to use all of the towels to get it cleaned up then had to go to the front desk to get more. I told the person at the front desk that  they probably should send housekeeping up to get the soaked towels and they said they would have it done in the morning, but when we got back that evening they were still in a huge pile on the bathroom floor.  The beds were comfy and clean but the pillows were on the thin side so one person had to use a minimum of 2 to get comfortable. The blankets on the bed were thin and  more like sheets. Housekeeping only came every 3rd day so we had to keep going to the front desk to get more towels. And when they did come, all they did was empty the trash and replenish the towels. They didn't change the sheets on the beds, vacuum or clean the bathroom either...kind of felt like it was halfway done. Continental breakfast was included and honestly it was terrible. The food service line was chaotic and disorganized. Guests were taking literal plates stacked with sausage, toast and fruit like it was an all you can eat buffet. Which caused the food service to take longer to replenish and in turn made the wait time longer. They really should have had workers serving the food to control this issue.

The room had ants and did not look clean at all specially the restroom. The internet NEVER worked with the instructions given. One employee in particular was extremely rude when asked if they had utensils since our delivery forgot to provide them. Employee replied “we don’t provide utensils” We had been at the Disney all day and just wanted to enjoy our meal after the hotel shuttle left us at another hotel. This really topped off the night. I pleaded if she could please look for a fork or something in the break room but very rudely with an unsympathetic manner she replied “you can go to the gift shop outside.” Shocked that in a hospitality business she was the opposite nor did she show concern or caringness to help. This night shift employee had blonde short hair with glasses. Overall my experience was anything but pleasant we made the best of it while there but there is plenty of other places.

Entrance to the most of the rooms from outside of the building. Guests must exit newer part of the building, walk through  parking lot to enter their rooms. There are few rooms in newer part of the building with corridor but most of the room's door opens wide to the parking lot. 12-story motel fits better to describe this place. Rooms have small tv, microwave oven and fridge. No coffeemaker. Not even a cup to drink a water. Safe is nailed to the floor just behind room entrance door without any kind of cabinet. Room cleaning is once in three days.
Their ""continental breakfast"" is a huge joke. Hotel offers to guests rubber taste boiled eggs, frozen waffles and week old bagels, couple items of fruits and pancakes. One pancake machine is dedicated to serve all guests in hotel. Because of quality of serving food most of the hotel guests attracted by pancake machine. People waiting on the line about 30-40 minutes for a couple of fresh baked pancakes. My first morning I waited on line but next day when I saw bigger line then before I went to IHop. IHop is a block or two from Ramada hotel.
Also, another problem is the ramp to hotels upper parking lot. Hotel have a parking lot on two levels. Some kind of genius decided to paint ramp to upper parking lot with very slippery paint. It is not a problem on dry sunny day but after a small rain it converts to a ski slope. I almost crashed rented car into a wall. I barely stopped car couple of inches from the wall.

The Pool isn’t huge at all it’s fairly small for them to have so many rooms ? Like they didn’t count for the ppl to occupy the pool at the same time ?

The  Gym closes ? The gym lol closes @10?  Which is crazy that the gym would close but the front desk is open 24/7?  This was a first for me a just fyi there’s only like 4 machines in there so it’s not as if they have so much to clean if needed ?

They charge $10 to receive small packages and $25 for large packages and you can't even add it to your checkout account, you have to pay when picking up the package. This limited my internet purchases.

The rooms have a structure that in my view is outdated (a little old) but everything works, in my case I stayed with the one with a kitchen and it is much bigger, the rooms are cleaned every 3 days but you can ask for towels at reception.

Os funcionários que cuidam das refeições e da limpeza são muito educados e atenciosos, o estacionamento é amplo e por mais cheio que o hotel esteja sempre tem vagas disponíveis, o quarto possui camas confortáveis e vista agradável, o local é seguro e muito bem localizado com tudo que vc precisar bem próximo como mercados e restaurantes (Walgreens, KFC, McDonald's, loja de bebidas, pizzarias, lojas de quinquilharias, etc) que dá pra ir a pé, fica próximo da Universal, Vulcano Bay e Outlet Premium.

O que achei bem desagradável foi o café da manhã, vários dias seguidos servindo ovo cozido como diferencial, em duas oportunidades serviram mini hambúrgueres, mas tinha café, leite, pães diversos, panquecas, suco de laranja e de maçã, de vez em quando tinha bananas, mas no geral as frutas eram laranja e maçã.

Cobram $10 para receber pacotes pequenos e $25 para grandes e nem pode adicionar na conta para checkout tem que pagar na retirada do pacote isso limitou minhas compras pela internet achei muito caro, fiquei em um hotel em Miami logo em seguida e paguei $5 por pacote.

According to the man I'm assuming was the manager, we were advised that the National Guard and the Department of Homeland Security had commandeered half the rooms in the hotel. They said our room wasn't ready then asked if we were OK with stairs.

I said it depended on how many and how steep as my husband can have problems due to poor vision. He impatiently told us to follow him and led us to the basement of the hotel. There were 15 steep steps into a short unswept hallway with all the maintenance rooms and inner workings for the hotel. We began to refer to it as the dungeon. When he asked us to inspect the room to see if we were satisfied, we were not expecting to see people vigorously scrubbing and cleaning. It seemed OK. We were tired after our long road trip and it was a very clean room. So, we blindly accepted. Then the fun began.

First thing, my husband got locked in the bathroom because the door knob assembly was broken and wouldn't open. I had to use a credit card in the door jamb to get him out. We reported it twice then were told it would be two hours until someone showed up to fix it. Then we realized we had no chairs and requested one - three times over 4-5 hours. Add on that the fact that the bathroom sink was clogged. Two times we went reported to the desk about that. Housekeeping came once during our three day stay and took most of the towels and all the washcloths from the bath. Never returned with fresh. Had to ask - again twice. They gave us more towels - no washcloths.

We had functioning internet one day out of our three day stay. I was told the problem was me. I worked IT for a bank so I can't be easily snowed. We had no issues at any subsequent motel. Lying to make me shut up is not great customer service.

The manager was fed up with me by this time. I have NEVER had to approach the desk more than once on any issue. In fact, I have rarely had to go to the front desk with a problem, we are easy going.

They charged us full price as though we enjoyed a properly furnished room (we didn't bother asking for lamps or bedtables). I'm not a fighter and neither is my husband. I will make my voice heard in my review. We fared better than most in that many people were called and their reservations cancelled. We were all there for the Bike NYC Ride and no one was at liberty to change their plans. There's some dirty business going on in this country.

I bought a special spray to help neutralize some of the outdoor after i entered the room. My flight home was canceled and it was last minute on a Friday, so it was one of the few options under 200 dollars in NY with free parking.

My room stared with a 4 but was one flight lower than the main level and there was no elevator in site! The room stunk, the TV has only basic cable channels, so i couldn't use my phone or smart TV features because there were none! The bathroom sink was clogged with water easily and it took forever to drain, the curtains did not close all the way- the semi-sheer white ones had a gap in between them and the tacky, decorative curtains on the sides did not close.

For a manager to say this to a guest is extremely unacceptable. I told him I will write a review. He said, that's fine, I actually encourage you to write a review, then maybe they will fix issues with the hotel.

so the thing with reviews is it's subjective-relative, meaning depending how sensitive and 'exposed' a person is, experience-wise, you get different feedback.

i am not picky, i am practical -and so is my girlfriend.. we picked this property for 3 reasons: location, parking costs AND the breakfast that's surprisingly decent enough for something that's free.

the rooms are not big, and there's only so much you can expect from the hustle and bustle of nyc. there is a building being constructed across and there are a lot of things this property can improve on.

for the price, that's a bonus. we could have paid more for the name, but again we are practical and frugal. i didnt mind the staff that may be loud, or inconsiderate when it comes to the elevator use (there is only 1) but for its price and the room upgrade that i got (i asked when i checked in and they gave it to me: 2 beds cost more than 1 king bed, i did it for the space), I'm not the one to complain..

things this property needs to work on:
shower pressure (when used by multiple rooms)
elevator use (have staff use before/after ""rush"" hour)
staff training on aseptic techniques (contamination)

things this property can boast about:
pricing (compare, do you homework)

First - and worst - of all: the toilet in my room didn't work. Even after they fixed it, it only flushed 50% of the time. There was a moldy leaky patch above the shower. No faucet in the bathtub so no bath. Shower got alternately hot and cold depending on what other guests were doing. It smelled weird - probably the cleaning products they used. The blinds were broken and falling down. The TV might as well not have been there, because you had to pay for everything except cable TV, so I used my computer for watching shows. Pillows were little cubes instead of actual pillows. I could hear the guests above me walking around. Lighting was not great, especially for makeup. The safe didn't work.

Service was terrible: 1) calling the front desk will put you on hold for several minutes, 2) I asked for a bath mat and blanket, but got two towels, a sheet, and a blanket?, 3) after I asked for the toilet to be fixed, it took two people and multiple minutes for them to figure out if it had been fixed or not.

- shower is very low, barely any water pressure, takes ages to get showered
- AC is as loud as a jet engine when turned on and does not cool that much. There is no possibility to sleep unless you are used to sleep on an aircraft runway

Pricing policy:
- Room gets advertised as a certain rate, however when checking in, tons of fees get added:
- 300$ safety deposit, this does get CHARGED from your card, not only reserved like all other hotels / car rentals. Fortunately they refunded it quickly after my stay, but it left a sour taste because you are not sure if you actually get it back
- 47$ / day per parking, gets advertised as 'its the best thing' even though free street parking is just one street a day
- 10$ / day for proper internet (who does that? The only free internet is barely enough for email)
- 1$ / night for using the safe (I did not use it and its not much, but why do you charge it? It just feels shameless and cheap)
- 12.5% + 0.2% + 3% extra tax, false advertising

However upon check out, the entire 1300$ deposit was still not taken back yet.

Next issue was the room. It smelled old and musty, the air-conditioning was terribly loud and they do not clean the rooms due to 'covid'. We had the feeling, that is an excuse so they don't have to hire as much staff, since the rooms still get cleaned after you check out. In that case, we feel you should not open if you can't have the staff to clean the hotel.

Even the walk to the touristy part of Hollywood is only 30 minutes or so.   The onsite staff also seemed pleasant.   That is where this ends though.

The hotel itself is rundown. Not gross, but definitely had a damp feel and just needs an overall revamp.

We were advised upon check-in that there is no longer housekeeping due to COVID.  There was no discount offered.  For a few days this would not be a big deal, but we were there for a week and definitely could have used some service.   As well, everyone was leaving their wet towels and garbage outside their room for pickup, so the halls looked like a back alley.

There was also an issue with the intercom system.  Somehow anytime the parking gate opened, a loud chirping would occur in the room.  This would happen all day and all night.  We were told this was affecting a lot of the rooms at the time, and we would be given a discount for 2 nights of no sleep.     These things happen, so I wasn't too mad about it and we were told that upon checkout we would get a refund for the two nights we were kept up.

At checkout we are told the refund will be processed later in the week.   We needed to get to the airport, so didn't want to push it.   We should have.   Over a month later and no refund has been processed.  I cannot get anyone to call me back (between emails and phone calls I'm up to over 10).

28171,1159,26183,2022-01-02,"Let me begin by saying I stay in a lot of hotels. I work in the entertainment industry and I travel a lot. I’m actually a resident of LA and will often rent rooms closer to the location I’m working at. I stayed here for a month with my kids and for the most part really enjoyed my stay. Let me clarify a few things, this is a Ramada not a 5 star hotel. I’m used to 5 stars with room service but this ain’t that so you can’t compare the 2. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. Idk why ppl are saying there’s no housekeeping, the house keepers are here everyday cleaning thoroughly. (Very sweet kind helpful cleaning staff). You just can’t be in the room when they clean due to COVID regulations. I agree with others that the carpet in the hallway does have an odor at times… it should be replaced in my opinion but you aren’t sleeping in the hallways so why does that matter? The staff is really kind and courteous. I don’t see how anyone has an issue with them , they were very attentive and kind to me and my children. This is LA be nice to ppl they’ll match your energy. The staff is professional and hard working. Maybe the other reviewers weren’t very nice first idk.
The building is a lil dated I will agree with that. The owner really could benefit from updating the bathrooms and making a few improvements without passing the cost onto the patrons (meaning I think they could make improvements and not raise the rates)
The cable is satellite and the channels don’t always work. It would have been nice to be able to cast/stream apps from my phone to the tv but no option for that. The wifi is free but parking isn’t. Parking is $40 a night in a secure lot. I definitely think it should be around $10 instead (my opinion). Free coffee with disposable cups in the room and some rooms have a mini fridge and microwave. They don’t have free breakfast at this location either because they don’t have a kitchen. There’s coin laundry at the end of the hallway by the vending and ice machines. 1 load is 3.50 to wash and 3.50 to dry (not bad you’re paying for convenience) The pool is currently closed which is a bummer. There’s a Starbucks in the same plaza and 2 healthy food stores across the street. Plenty of clubs and restaurants, the famous Beverly Center mall about a mile away and infamous Sunset strip a few blocks away. The location is perfect. Very safe area. All things considered, you can’t really complain.

28176,1159,26188,2021-07-18,"I stayed in non-smoking, executive suite with a king bed for 2 nights, and started getting concerned when I read the most recent June 2021 reviews on TripAdvisor about rooms having a smell. Let me start with the positives: the sheets/bedding, bathroom, and towels were clean👍👍 The front desk staff were extremely courteous, and were clear about disclosing the $40/day garage parking fee, as well as the temporary halt in daily turndown service due to Covid. However, I also got the impression that they were working with limited resources, and put in a position where they just had to make due. My biggest issue was that my non-smoking room had clearly been smoked in by a previous, inconsiderate guest. The smell was severe. If I had any plans to actually hang around the hotel, rather than being out and about, I would have gone somewhere else. When I checked out, I told the people at the front desk that the room either needed a deep clean or a change to a smoking designation. They apologized sincerely, but clearly didn’t have the bandwidth to do anything about it. So my impression is that this is really part of some larger issue that the higher managers at this location haven’t properly dealt with. Google lists this place as a 3 star hotel, but I would really categorize it as a 2, if not lower.
To summarize: Sheets/towels/bathroom were clean. Day-to-day staff were very courteous and capable. Location in West Hollywood was fantastic. Room had been cleaned upon arrival, but the smell indicated it was not actually clean. Something had clearly deteriorated at this location recently based on the good reviews I read from 2+ years ago.

This morning the manager tells me that this is the hotel's policy and the fact that someone made fraudulent charges ONE HOUR AFTER THEY PHOTOCOPIED MY CARD is a coincidence!  The fact that they have a swipe machine and ALSO make a photocopy and then claim it is because they can't use the imprint machine from 1989 sitting on the desk there is a lie. They probably use that solely to record card numbers too.  You don't need an imprint or photocopy if you take a swipe of the card to authorize purchases, incidentals, etc.

The hotel is also dirty, the rooms smell strongly of the artificial, synthetic air freshener preferred by the desperate classes, etc. I was expecting that because $200 a night in West Hollywood is asking for a rough accommodation in inflationary America. I expected that, but not theft.

If you're looking for attentive service or even a pleasant greeting, you are in the wrong place!!!    There is also a $33 nightly charge for parking here.  This wasn't stated on my reservation or confirmation when I booked the room.  If I'd known, I might have chosen to stay somewhere else.

When I pulled into the lot there was a sign saying ""valet $33"", I asked the valet if there was self parking for less. At no point did he say that the $33 was for ANY parking and that the valet service was included. He directed me to park on an upper level and take the stairs down to the street level for check in. I hauled all my bags across the parking lot and down a flight and a half of stairs only to be told at the front desk that I was going to be charged $33.   I explained to the clerk what I hadn't valet parked and he informed me that I would be charged the $33. I told the clerk what the valet had said and politely asked if there was anything he could do to remedy the situation.  He told me there was nothing he could do. The manager walked by as I was talking to the clerk, so I asked him about the parking situation.  He was rude and even more unresponsive than the front desk clerk.  He literally turned his back on me and walked away. At no point did anyone express even the slightest bit of care or concern. Not even a simple ""sorry for the misunderstanding"", much less an offer of an  upgrade like most other hotels. They really couldn't care less about their guests if they tried.  He literally shrugged his shoulders, turned his back on me and walked.  I've never experienced a less interested or more unprofessional hotel manager Ever!!

As if that wasn't enough, after swallowing the parking fee I get to my room. It is ok so far.  Turns out the walls are thin, you can hear every person in the hallway walk by and the guy in the next room is getting lucky and very vocal.  Save yourself some heartache and stay away.

I’ve not loved it, especially the “upgrade” rooms with squeaky stairs you have to go navigate from the upstairs sleeping area to the bathroom on the lower level. Still, the location is good, and the rates aren’t too crazy expensive.

But after last night, I’m never staying there again.

I just left the hotel after getting about 4 hours of sleep. We walked into the room yesterday and it smelled like someone spilled an entire bottle of air freshener in the room. I went to the front desk to request another room, but they said they were sold out. They suggested turning on the A/C and opening up the window to air it out.  I left for dinner and when I returned, it still smelled terrible. After trying to sleep with my face under the covers, I called the front desk to see if there might be another room... no luck. I opened the window and turned off the A/C which helped a tiny bit, but the street noise kept me up for a while.

Then at 6:00 am, the alarm clock in the room went off, apparently a leftover from a previous guest. I am not in the habit of checking if an alarm clock is set in a hotel room.

At that point, I was so pissed off, I couldn’t get back to sleep.

I went to the front desk to complain, and all they did was waive the $33 parking charge. No discount on the room. We were told that the management company orders that fragrance to be sprayed in the air conditioners.

The Ramada Inn was and is a pretty fab hotel like I really enjoyed it. I was able to get some rest before a shoot I had and the location is great for someone who is just visiting and traveling and enjoys the scene and then ambiance of West Hollywood.

I had a few guest over and also had a friend stay the night on one of the beds.

The next morning, the morning of November 20, 2016. I woke up with a terrible itch on my body; mostly the right side.

My arm and back was just covered in bed bug bites.

I am a model and I had two shoots to do while I was in town and neither did I have anytime in between checking out and other plans to physically check the bed or tell anyone in management that day but also I wanted to make sure that these were bed bug bites that I have found on my body and not just some sort of allergic reaction.

The itching and biting didn't stop and I've had to go to friends place afterwards and was totally embarrassed. I hope that I did not give them bed bugs.

I called management and got to speak to an assistant who then told me that she'll check the room and see what's going on and give me a call back today is now November 30, 2016 and have not received anything.

That call was recorded and also video of the bed bug bites.",2,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0.9429,hey guy go november 1922 check ramada inn west hollywood stay room 218 ramada inn pretty fab hotel like really enjoy able get rest shoot location great someone visit travel enjoy scene ambiance west hollywood guest also friend stay night one bed next morning morning november 20 2016 wake terrible itch body mostly right side arm back cover bed bug bite model two shoot town neither anytime check plan physically check bed tell anyone management day also want make sure bed bug bite find body sort allergic reaction itch bite do not stop I ve go friend place afterwards totally embarrassed hope give bed bug call management got speak assistant tell shell check room see what s go give call back today november 30 2016 receive anything call record also video bed bug bite

28609,1076,26623,2023-01-26,"I visit Orlando frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels around international drive. First and foremost, I cannot recommend the Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Orlando Resort & Suites Intl Drive. Hampton Inn near Universal Blv/International Dr was a better experience than the stay I just had at Ramada.

Financial transparency, I booked third party through Hotwire for a last minute deal that was cheaper than what was offered by Ramada. The total spent for two nights was $214. When I arrived for check-in the deposit was greater than the total amount to stay at $250. For two nights, a deposit of $250 is inane. I asked the front desk if I can have a hold of $200. Front desk said no, I didn’t push for other suggestions and let it be.

Based on deposit alone, my suggestion is to go to any other hotel in the area because they’re likely to charge a deposit based on each night. My sister was staying nearby at Kinetic formerly Crowne Plaza and they only charged $50 a night for a deposit. Heck, when I stayed in Oct. 2022 Hampton Inn only charge $50 for 4 nights.

We stayed in a room in the south tower on the twelfth floor. Front desk made a comment about how great the view is. While, yes, the view was nice the room was not. The south tower is all rooms facing outside like a motel. The chosen photos presented made it seem like we would have rooms attached to a hallway that was inside. The room itself is outdated and the carpet didn’t seem very clean. We quickly deposited our bags into our room, did a quick mattress check for bugs, and turned on the AC so we could have a cool room to return to. When we came back we saw dead bugs had been blasted onto the bed that was nearest the AC unit. We then noticed bugs crawling though a small hole above the entry door and through cracks in the floor of the bathroom. At this point I don’t wanna deal with it and move all of our stuff to a new room, so we ride it out for another night. We also discover our tv doesn’t work properly. Quite frankly, the staff will say we should have told them about the bugs because “they’re in the business of hospitality,” but I’m of firm belief you shouldn’t be putting guests in rooms that have issues to begin with. If a guest has to request a new room because the room itself is defective, it’s already a bad stay.

We tried out the bar in the lobby. All drinks must be paid for at the front desk. Once you tell the front desk your drink choice and pay, they hand you carnival tickets that say either beer or wine. You then walk from the front desk to the bar and hand your drink ticket to the bartender to get your drink. I felt like I was at a middle school fundraiser.

Breakfast. This was the MAIN reason I booked this hotel. I almost stayed at the Kinetic with my sister, but they didn’t offer breakfast so I went with Ramada. The breakfast is trash. It’s nearly all bread. Toast, cereal, bagels, pancakes, waffles, donut holes. The first morning they provide one traditional protein option which was sausage patties (that tasted like vegan patties) and what looked like yogurt in a buffet style ceramic white dish on ice. There was milk, apple juice, orange juice, hot water decaf coffee, and the worst coffee served as well. The coffee was like getting your free cup from the waiting room at your local mechanic, except I would drink my mechanics coffee. I could not drink the coffee Ramada served. Breakfast was a major disappointment. I went to the front desk and asked if they serve eggs. The front desk person said the serve eggs every other morning. The following morning it was just boiled eggs.

Upon checkout we let them know of the issues but they were dismissive and they couldn’t do anything because we booked third party. I understand the third party issue and an amenable to a hotel’s limitations, but this was just poor hospitality all around. Also, the front desk made it very clear they were NOT short staffed. The Shah Family and its property management need to do better. This Ramada is only nice in name.

28627,1076,26641,2022-12-03,"I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights and I would have given the hotel a 4 out of 5. However, I subtracted an extra 2 points due to an experience that I felt had been handled inappropriately. I rated the product based on the overall experience.
Pros:
Lake view and relatively clean.
Close to many restaurants and attractions.
Cons:
Room did not have cups. Putting plastic cups would not cost much and would improve the experience.
No drinking water, tea or coffee. People who arrive late at night wouldn't have access to stores to purchase supplies. Having water, tea and coffee at the lobby would be a cost-effective solution to boost experience.
I would put shuttle service as a pro, but the experience from last Saturday was less than satisfactory. The hotel contracted the shuttle service to Universal Studio, Disney and Seaworld to a company. I used the service last Saturday (Nov 26) for Universal Studio and the bus broke down halfway while the driver was driving to pick up guests from other hotels. The driver then called his supervisor who instructed him to tell the passengers to catch an Uber. Keep in mind that this is a TRANSPORTATION company that has been contracted to take the guests to their destination.
Here were the problems associated with how the shuttle service handled the problem:
- Safety concerns - Many of the guests were tourists, including me, and there should not be any assumption that everyone had access to a phone or a data plan at a foreign location. People could get lost. I had informed the clerk at the front desk that night when I returned of what had happened. No follow-ups had occurred.
- Contractual obligation - As a transportation company, the hotel had contracted the service of transporting their guests between the attraction sites and the hotels. If the service broke down, then it would only be reasonable that the transportation company provide alternative arrangements. This did not happen. Perhaps the hotel should build in contingency plans in the event the service got delayed or the shuttle broke down into the contract. I saw the situation as the hotel paying for a service that the transportation company did not deliver.
- Added out of pocket expense - If the shuttle service was included to the room, then the expectation was that there would not be extra expense from transportation to Universal Studios. By telling the guests to take an Uber, the guests had to pay out of pocket for a service that should have been provided on top of the inconvenience.
As the shuttle service was part of the hotel package, the rating for the product had to take a hit and would have to remove 2 stars from the review.

The rooms are dated, the TV is tiny with terrible reception (noisy picture quality on all channels), and even though we have a suite with a kitchen, it does not contain any drinks facility like a coffee machine or kettle. I thought every hotel in the US had a keurig machine!

I'm lying awake now because the aircon is so ridiculously loud... bring ear plugs.

Also the 'club level' bonuses aren't nearly as good as they sound, the sky bar is very very limited and closes at 8pm, the complimentary snacks are just pringles and the 'spa' is a tiny tiny pool. Not worth paying for. We went up there soon after arriving and the bartender said 'what's your room number? Are you even allowed to be up here?' Weirdly rude, given we entered using our keycards, were dressed nicely and were very polite to her.

The pool and spa were very clean and we're very fun to lounge in. The hotel is about a 20 min drive to Disney and maybe 5 min to Universal if there is no traffic. There are lots of restaurants and shops in walking distance in case you have free time in your itinerary. There is free WiFi but don't expect to have amazing speeds and connection. Free parking as well.

My only gripe is that they really need to clean the water in the lake next to the pool. There is lots of garbage there and I feel bad for the fish and birds that live/eat there. I saw someone flick a cigarette in the lake. A shame really.

28660,1076,26674,2022-05-24,"Like a lot of hotels, a fair bit of effort is put into keeping the communal areas clean and tidy, unfortunately this is at the expense of the rooms which are a bit tired. The real let down though is the breakfast. There's a couple of cereals, bread, waffles and pancakes that you need to make yourself. The pancake machine takes 1 minute to make 2 small pancakes and there is generally a long queue meaning 10 minute or more waits are common. It's common for the food to run out, waiting on replenishment adds to the delays. The staff are also pretty ignorant, upon check in, I was given absolutely no information and when I enquired about the basics e.g. breakfast times etc, I was left in no doubt that it was an effort for them to provide any. The wifi in the communal areas is good but in many of the rooms is next to useless. If you're tempted by the free transfers to the parks, don't be. There's a single bus to Disney at 09:25 returning at 19:45 or 22:30 and a single transfer to universal at 07:10, returning at 18:00. The drivers of the free shuttle are never on time and like the hotel staff, give the impression that simply doing their job is a major hassle. They act like they're doing you a favor, instead of doing what they're paid to do. The only good thing about the transfer is it's a bit of a prelude to the thrill rides at the parks. The drivers spend so long looking at their phone, texting while driving that you'll often find the bus switching all over the roads, almost crapping into other vehicles and jamming on the brakes at the last minute.",3,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0.9765,like lot hotel fair bit effort put keep communal area clean tidy unfortunately expense room bit tired real let though breakfast there s couple cereal bread waffle pancake need make pancake machine take 1 minute make 2 small pancake generally long queue mean 10 minute wait common common food run waiting replenishment add delay staff also pretty ignorant upon check give absolutely information enquire basic eg breakfast time etc leave doubt effort provide wifi communal area good many room next useless you re tempt free transfer park do not there s single bus disney 0925 return 1945 2230 single transfer universal 0710 return 1800 driver free shuttle never time like hotel staff give impression simply job major hassle act like they re favor instead they re pay good thing transfer bit prelude thrill ride park driver spend long look phone texting drive you ll often find bus switch road almost crap vehicle jamming brake last minute
28661,1076,26675,2021-12-15,"Updated stay 12/10/21: I stayed in a regular suite this visit. I wasn't as impressed. There were no glasses in the room, the mini fridge door was on backwards and it made it extremely difficult to access. I didn't bother with breakfast this visit. I would've used the jacuzzi at night but for some stupid reason they close the pools at 8. I thought about using the jacuzzi during the day but the view of lake algae wasn't very appealing so I passed.

Stay 9/23/21: I stayed in a club suite and have found a true gem! The room is great and quiet. The rooms have mini fridges, microwaves and 2 burner stoves (but no pans or other kitchen wares so I'm not sure what the point of those are) but no coffee makers. The room has a deep jetted tub but it didn't work. The room also had a comfy robe to wear.

The continental breakfast consists of bread, bagels, cereal, apples, sausage, coffee, juice, etc. Personally, I didn't care for it.

The best part of the club rooms is the exclusive rooftop lounge. The skybar is INCREDIBLE! The snacks and alcohol are limited, but the atmosphere, view, and service were AMAZING!!! Hilda and Carine took such great care of us. I just wished it was open later. The pools all close at 8pm.

I had a suit with double queen beds overlooking International Blvd. The lobby was nice and I loved the sunken area for the bar downstairs as it was semi separated into its own area. The bar seating was very nice allowing for small or large groups to sit comfortably. The pool area was small but had a great view looking over the water toward the other resorts. The hotel was clean throughout and did not have any funky odors despite the number of people moving through.

However, I did not know the rooftop area was exclusive to people staying in club rooms and I didn't know there was a fee for using the in room safe. Having the safe was a must for me due to concealed carrying on my trip, and wanting to have my firearm secured in my room while at Universal Studios. The safe was easy to use, but is too small to store a laptop or bulky electronics. I did not use the fitness center which is also located on the roof through the doors to the rooftop bar.  The bar in the lobby was having issues with transactions made with card(I told this was an ongoing problem). An elevator did breakdown my second night there and caused a bottleneck the next morning since there was only two elevators total.

28669,1076,26683,2021-11-01,"This was a beautiful hotel, very close to our favorite theme park!

We booked through booking.com where it allowed us to view other booking options that included club level access.

We ended up getting there a little late, but staff was good about getting us out keys and parking pass. You need to give your license plate number, so be sure to have that handy for an easy check in. I'm glad I have mine memorized. I liked that the doors are locked after a certain time and you can't enter without a key. You also need your key to move throughout the hotel on the elevators.

At first, I was a little disappointed in the room. There were some stains on the sheets and the floor and the couch was dingy and uncomfortable, but otherwise, the room was clean. We had two queen size beds and a living area with a pullout couch. We brought a Roku for the time we spent watching any TV.

We had club level access and were able to go upstairs to the 12th floor for free beer/wine and appetizers. They ordered domino's pizza for the club level people and it was unlimited. There were not many people there and it was nicely spaced out. They have a pool and hot tub up there with tanning chairs and bathrooms.

I was however disappointed in their breakfast. The only thing I could truly enjoy was the waffles, which were frozen eggo waffles and a small blueberry muffin. I got cereal, but the milk was not cold, it was almost room temperature. They had begals with cream cheese, toast and other breads, but no meats. We went fairly early, but late enough to where breakfast had been going on for about 45 minutes. There was an assortment of different juices that were cold and you retrieve those from a container that was keeping them chilled.

28683,1076,26697,2021-05-09,"Booked this reservation through booking.com and was excited for “a great deal” for the family suite. The other amenities I booked for were the included breakfast and hotel shuttle service.

When arriving at the hotel, we were informed that both the breakfast and hotel shuttle service had been discontinued because of Covid. Both of these, as of may 8, 2021 were still listed on booking and the official Ramada website. I would have absolutely booked somewhere else had I known these would not be included.

Next, I had to pay for 2 deposits because I booked 2 rooms. What I booked was the family suite with 2 bedrooms. Horribly misleading. What I got was a connecting room with 4 queens. The deposit amount? $250 per room. That was almost as much as the reservation itself.

All in all, the staff is nice, friendly and accommodating. The hotel is clean. Disappointed there were no dishes in the rooms with kitchens. All the misleading statements and amenities were aggravating. I will absolutely never stay here again. And I will fight for a refund for the amount of money I had to spend on Ubers and other public transportation.

Don’t stay here.

The views of Volcano Bay were awesome and well as the swings at night!  The pool was lovely and their bar is amazing too!  We also enjoyed their huge kitchen that they serve breakfast in!  If you need to do your laundry they also have that option!

Swimming pool was nice.

What I Disliked:
1-The bathroom wasn't clean (we found hair in the tub and on the floor) and the sink drain was clogged.
2-The mattresses were extremely uncomfortable, we informed the front desk and they said they will change them for us, it came out worse than before.
3-Pillows were so lumpy, hard on one side, soft/ empty on the other side, we ask for different pillows and the answer was all pillows at Ramada Plaza are as such !!!!! but they actually put 3 good pillows by the end of the day 2.
4-When we checked in, they told us that breakfast is from 6-9:30. We went down to breakfast very early on the first two days of our stay since we wanted to catch the shuttle bus to the park. First day they offered eggs and donuts alongside continental breakfast items. Second day there were hash browns with the usual continental items.
Third day, we went down at 8:40 am and there were literally NO FOOD (even bread was out) except for the waffle machine that had a line so long we preferred to stay without breakfast on that day. I asked to speak to the manager and I told her about that. She said breakfast is till 9, I told her how they mentioned 9:30 in the flyer they gave to us on day one and that even if the breakfast is till 9, we arrived 20 minuted before that and there were no food. they should know in advance how many guests they have in the hotel and prepare enough food accordingly.
I thought my remarks will be taken into consideration for the next day. I went to breakfast at 8 am, and there were only the sad continental items, no eggs, donuts, hash brown and any other special things (That was Thanksgiving day !!!!)
5- All breakfast plates and cups were made from Styrofoam. the number of people having breakfast was enormous which means: pollution to the environment !!! I can't believe that such big companies still use those items instead of recyclable items !!!!

28723,1076,26737,2019-12-08,"1) it’s certainly not within walking distance of Universal theme parks, unless you want to walk 30+ minutes. Maybe the “one mile” is a direct straight line measurement?
2) the shuttle runs at very inconvenient times, it doesn’t even run all day, it only has 3 pick up times anyway, and the last shuttle back to the hotel is at 645pm (parks don’t close until 8) God forbid you want to spend time at Citywalk. Granted CW parking is free after 6 but if you want to indulge you can’t expect to use the hotel shuttle for safe travel, as it’s not running after dinner.
3) water damage all over the hallway walls, carpets, and ceilings. “Wet paint” signs to make it appear as if they have done repairs or upgrades but the bubbled water damaged wallpaper is blaring and obvious, as is the stench of mold. Not to mention in my mothers room it looked like the toilet from the floor above was going to come right through her ceiling. The ceiling was clearly damaged from a water leak and has not been repaired, in a Club Suite no less.
3.5) stains all over the couch, floors, ceilings- thank god these rooms don’t come with black lights.
4) you get a kitchenette but nothing is provided as far as cutlery, dishes, pans. According to another review you have to request to have dishes/etc to use your kitchenette. Paper towels aren’t even provided in the kitchenettes. Paper freaking towels.
5) 4 people in my room, not enough towels, and zero wash rags, etc for each person.
6) mattresses were AWFUL. If you want to reminisce on your days of air mattress adventures, you know when the air seeps out and you’re sleeping in a valley of mattress taco in the middle? Yeah that’s how these were, except they were actual mattresses and they DEFINITELY had springs because I could feel every one of them. We tried both beds. Both were awful.
7) Curly, black hairs in the shower. They were NOT ours. Plural. Hairs.
7.5) Revisiting the lack of repairs, our towel rack fell off the wall when a single towel was attempting to be hung from it. I mean, there was an attempt at repairing it. Some one has previously stuffed wads of Kleenex in the hole to keep the rod base attached.
8) wads of tangled hair on the bathroom floor. Again not ours. This was even there After the cleaning staff came the second day.
8) Breakfast, lackluster and not equivalent to the hotels price point. Styrofoam plates. If I don’t have any plates in my kitchenette, there should be more than enough to serve breakfast on.
9) Over Charging. They attempted to charge my mother an additional $100 upon check in when her room was already reserved and had a deposit down. It took some time to get the issue resolved. Thankfully, it was resolved.
10) Price point. This hotel is charging way beyond what it is worth. It is no where near what it boasts. This is a high rise Motel 6, if you will. The only reason they can charge this much is because it is near the attractions. Find a different place to stay.

However for the price, we found it to be the best.. Not much of service is required at this place but free breakfast and parking is added benefit.. The extra star for service is for KAINA at front desk.. She was very nice and courteous and always greeted with a smile.. her positive aura and attitude of explaining stuff with happy eyes was something we would remember and cherish.. Wish her the best !!!

IMPORTANT TO NOTE
this hotel has two towers, the main(front) tower has suite rooms with closed foyer and the back tower has standard rooms which have open foyer.. however, not much traffic noise reached us at 10th floor when we stayed in the back tower.. the rooms are dated but have all the amenities including comfortable beds and with fridge and microwave which is most imp of all considering the fact that a tourist would be out of the hotel the whole day..

I travelled with my wife and 8 yr old daughter and we kept one day breaks between the park days.. ICON park, Wonder works, Ripleys etc and many such attractions are within 30 min walk of the hotel.. the pool is good with an option of hot water jacuzzi by it which is operational till 11 am. the hotel is nicely maintained with clean areas and a good lobby.. the breakfast was decent but there are many restrictions unless you are guest at the suites which was a little unwelcome feature.

28742,1076,26756,2020-07-23,"Stayed here for a week 2 weeks ago. Got upgraded to a 1 king bed w/kitchenette with city view.

PROS:
- Staff is friendly, well-mannered, and polite
- Room was spacious
- Didn't get the lake view, but enjoyed watching the slingshot while it was lit at night (hotel is next to a small thrill park)
- Pool was clean with beautiful view of lake
- Kitchenette was manageable w/ 2 burners

CONS:
- Physical location scenery was not welcoming; It's behind a plaza
- One elevator stopped working, so it took longer to go up and down with more guests staying towards the weekend; I wouldn't have mentioned this but when I told the front desk that my card wasn't working, they brushed me off after they checked my card and said it was working. So, sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. Finally, the next day someone else had complained and they left the elevator shut on the second floor. Confirmation that I wasn't crazy. Also, they never left a sign that it was out of service, so newer guests never realized that it didn't work. It just appeared that the elevator was on the second floor. It's a bit deceiving.

The room windows were very dirty, and the beds were very, very firm. Even looking at the two towers from the pool deck, you could tell where the higher paying customers stayed. The north tower was clean, and taken care of. The south tower was nasty, with dirty windows and debris.
Housekeeping was not the best throughout our stay. Halfway through, they noticed the shower curtain was gross, so they took it down. They did not replace it, and we had to call the front desk to have a new one brought up. The pillowcases also disappeared, and were brought back around 7pm. The toilet paper roll was not restocked near the end of our visit (they did not leave extras in the room), and my husband had to go down to the desk to get more.

The rooftop pool and fitness center advertised on the website are only for the customers staying in the suites on the top floors of the north tower. No one from the other tower or floors has access. We spent our trip waiting for the children (yes children!!) to leave the hot tub so we could enjoy it in the evenings.

The free hot breakfast was much to be desired as well. The make your own waffles and toast is not what we were expecting when we saw the website. FYI- Hyatt serves eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and much more for their free breakfast!
The mini fridge in the room was more of a mini freezer as well. It froze all of our food solid! Even the alcoholic beverages were slushies!

The free shuttle to the local attractions only runs once to the parks, and once back to the hotel from the parks. It was 20 minutes late on the first day we tried to use it. We opted to pay for Uber rides to avoid being left at the parks for 10+ hours.

Overall, I would recommend staying at another hotel in the Orlando area. The hotel just across the lake (Westgate Palace) is not much more, and has full kitchens to cook in!  I wish we would have demanded our money back and found a new hotel during our stay!",2,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0.7858,book hotel vacation research website live expectation check arrive room find date welcome bathroom clean tub yellowed drip mark side shower curtain stain vent cake dust bug squish wall ceiling room window dirty bed firm even look two tower pool deck could tell high pay customer stay north tower clean take care south tower nasty dirty window debris housekeeping well throughout stay halfway notice shower curtain gross take replace call front desk new one bring pillowcase also disappear bring back around 7 pm toilet paper roll restock near end visit leave extras room husband go desk get rooftop pool fitness center advertise website customer stay suite top floor north tower one tower floor access spend trip wait child yes child leave hot tub could enjoy evening free hot breakfast much desire well make waffle toast expect see website fyi hyatt serve egg bacon sausage potatoe much free breakfast mini fridge room mini freezer well freeze food solid even alcoholic beverage slushie free shuttle local attraction run park back hotel park 20 minute late first day try use opt pay uber ride avoid leave park 10 hour overall would recommend stay another hotel orlando area hotel across lake westgate palace much full kitchen cook wish would demanded money back find new hotel stay

Breakfast was included in room rate with very little variety.
We were sent to an old building, not the main tower. Upon getting to the old, dirty and outdated room we felt a terrible smell of wet dog mixed with mold/mildew and something else that I cannot even describe, it was really awful. Call to the front desk and the stuff was prompted to help, they sent a sweet lady with an “air freshener” to see if it would help with the air conditioning on, but it wasn’t effective at all. We stayed in for that night, which I will regret for the rest of my life, we barely sleep, my 2 year old baby cried and cough for all night and my allergy symptoms got pretty bad.
Early in the morning went to front desk and they promised to have another room as soon as they could, we got a new room in the afternoon when we came back from the park, much clean but the same old aspect.
Also, the refrigerator in the first room was broken.
Conclusion: we spent the first night in a dump room which we paid for it.
I really hope that Bedfinder could take more responsibility making partnership to offer or represent a product, they must be sure that they are not putting clients in such situation.

28812,1076,26826,2018-10-20,"My husband and I stayed here a couple of weeks ago and it was very pleasant. When you first walk in to the hotel it smells clean, and the lobby is nicely decorated with plenty of seating. There’s 2 bars available in the hotel one is in the lobby for everyone, and the other is on the rooftop of the main building. The rooftop bar is only available to those who are staying in rooms on the 9th floor and up. The pool/hot tub looked nice and inviting. Everyone was very nice from the front desk to the housekeeping staff. The location was great! Very close to everything stores, restaurants, shops, attractions, universal studios area. We actually walked to the ihop down the street. You do have to use your hotel key to go up in the elevators just an fyi. Parking is very convenient they have their own parking lot and parking garage just give the front desk the description of the vehicle you have with you. The rooms were nice. The beds and pillows were very comfortable and with a huge king size bed, haha. The view of the lake was also nice. There is a fee if you want to use the room safe. The shower was hot and with good water pressure.
Now for why I’m giving 3 stars, I see why people said the rooms were outdated and they are. We didn’t feel “dirty” after leaving but they do need some updates. The toilet was also really close to the bathroom door and shower making it a tight fit. The tv was a Samsung brand but it was small and not the greatest of quality for tv’s. One thing that did annoy us was the free breakfast they offered. All that’s available is waffles, cereal, toast, and fruit. Usually a free breakfast includes eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns. We were just looking for something more which is why we went to ihop both mornings we were there. Overall would I stay here again? Yes we would. Also my card was not cloned or anything.

When looking at hotels online, the first one that popped up was this Ramada and one of the features stated, 'Newly Built'. We browsed through photos and booked it immediately. Upon arrival just a few days later, we walked into the lobby and were blown away. It was absolutely beautiful! It was brand new and smelled clean; everything about it was perfect. Or so it seemed. We got the keys to our room and the woman told us to exit through the automatic door. We knew something was up. We walked out of the brand new hotel into a dark, outdoor hallway. We went to the elevators and saw that one was broken. After waiting five minutes, the elevator finally returned and we got on and went to our room. As we opened the door, we could feel the heat in the room. The air conditioner had been turned off and it was at least 85ºF. We turned the air on right away and unpacked all of our bags. I was just miserable. The photos totally misled me to believe that we were going to stay in some nice, new hotel. I took a shower to see if that would help me relax. It made it worse. I opened the shower curtain and found a roach crawling around the tub. I simply splashed it away with water. I finished my shower and told my family we had to leave. There was no way I was going to stay in that room with a struggling air conditioner in the middle of the summer with a large gap underneath the door. We went to leave for dinner and as we walked away from the old, stinky hotel into the new hotel, I had a question for the front desk. We simply asked, ""How do we stay in this building specifically?"" She replied with, ""I already understand. It's usually an extra $90, but I'll give it to you for one payment of $50."" She gave us a tour of the newly built room and we were once again blown away. We quickly ran back to our old room, got all of our things and headed back to our brand new room. It was so nice! We had separate areas to sleep, two TVs! The air was ice cold, we had floor to ceiling windows, a bigger, cleaner bathroom, etc. We loved it! The free breakfast was great as well; they had a lot to offer. This was one of our best trips to Orlando and I know it's because of this hotel.

28843,1076,26857,2017-07-19,"First let me state that we stayed in the North tower, where the main reception is located and widely accepted as the superior tower , I cannot therefore comment on the South tower.
We also had booked the more exclusive rooms which are on the top floors 9, 10, 11 & 12. We had 2 adjoining rooms 919 & 921 (city view)

We were very happy with the rooms, cleaned and re-supplied with towels and toiletries, bottled water most days (the odd day we had to chase up the housekeeper for towels) There were enough sockets, two LCD TV's (happy to report that Fox News was broadcast, fair & balanced, ha ha) Plenty of different stations for all tastes.
Bubble bath, shower, microwave, fridge, hairdryer, iron and board, air con (which was quiet and efficient)

The bad bits regarding the room was no cutlery, plates etc, only disposable ones. The lifts - sometimes they were programmed to your room card and took several swipes to work, other days they were on ""free access"" were you did not need the card, no big deal. It did mean that other floors accessed the breakfast room on the 2nd floor which is only meant for the guests from floors 9 - 12, but again no big deal, we always got seated.

We also got access to the roof-top bar and pool, free beer, wine & snacks from noon until 20:00. Pool is small, seats comfortable and views are nice. You will be checked to see if your entitled to avail of this by the bar staff up there. We only went up there twice mainly due to the attitude of ""Hilda"" who made us feel she was buying the drink for us out of her own pocket. She seemed to have the same group of people she looked after very well, permitting them to vape but not allowing it of others who we observed asking.

Reception staff were polite and efficient,  special mention for Arlene for her professionalism. A simple rule, show respect to staff and you'll receive respect and good service in return.
Note: that reception do charge $10 for signing and storing any items that you may order on-line for delivery to the hotel, so it's well to know that in advance.

Location is great, handy to catch the i-trolley to the outlets and many eateries within a few minutes walk. Highly recommend the Long Horn steak house, one of the best meals I ever had, I intend to give it, it's own review later.

For the smokers booking in, it is a non-smoking hotel so one must stand outside, it could do with a seated area just for that purpose.

The ""Guest Services"" lady is not very friendly nor very enthusiastic about her job, we bought I-Trolley passes from her but never went back to her for the rest of our tickets because of her attitude,  so she lost out in hundred's of dollars that we spent up around the corner in Attraction Tickets Outlet (beside Payless Shoes) for numerous day trips that we bought.

Over-all we enjoyed our stay and will return. We have recommended this hotel to our friends.

28855,1076,26869,2019-02-13,"This is an awful hotel. In fact, calling it a ‘hotel’ is extremely generous.

- Our (initial) room was on the ground floor. The window opened directly out to the pool area - if you want any natural light in the room you have to expose your room and yourself to anyone in the pool area as the glass is not tinted from the outside. In addition, the room door opened straight to the parking lot which was easily accessible from the street. This didn’t feel safe at all.

- On the penultimate night of our stay, the roof above one of the beds began to drip profusely. In fairness to the Ramada, as soon as this issue was raised we were moved to a new room. However, as the hotel was full, this did not happen until after check in time (i.e after 3pm). Therefore we had to re-pack our bags, leave them with the hotel for the day, then pick the bags up again only to have to immediately repack for our departure.

- The bathroom was terrible. The shower head was about 2 feet below my height. There was no bathroom fan. The floor wasn’t mopped after cleaning, which is necessary given the dilapidated shower curtain. For half of our stay there was no ‘hot’ water, only lukewarm water.

- The room fridge reeked heavily of chlorine, as if it had been cleaned with pool water.

- The beds don’t have real pillows - just three half pillows, such as the type one might place as decorations on a sofa, masquerading as real ones.

- The advertised ‘fast wifi’ is a complete fallacy. The internet was so slow that it took 15 minutes to load a standard website. It also continually drops out and requires signing in again.

- The included breakfast was nothing more than bread, hard boiled eggs and some make your own waffles. It was all served on polystyrene plates and paper cups for the awful coffee.

- The bus service to local attractions could not be listed for more inconvenient times. Given that most people staying at this dump are here for Disney World or Universal, three services to each at 7, 11 & 12 is simply not good enough. It either requires a very early wake up, or a departure so late as to waste half a day. Ended up having to pay ~$50 a day for an Uber to the park.

- On our first night at the Ramada, a number of advertising pamphlets were slipped under the door for a local pizza restaurant. This turned out to be a scam in order to get your credit card details. Luckily I was not scammed, however, I only found out about the scam from another hotel guest and not the Ramada itself. This raises the obvious security question of how did the pamphlet get slipped under the door and why was the hotel not aware or informing guests of this happening?

- On top of all this, at departure I had the lovely surprise of being greeted with a Bill for $2 a night + tax for utilising the safe in my room. This hotel is so cheap that they charge you to store your valuables safely.

In summary, if you have any other option, steer clear of this joint at all costs.

All this said, it is cheap and if you’re coming for the parks you’re going to be spending most of your time there anyway. I would steer clear of this place if you were going to Disney and intending to use the shuttle service, however it is only a short uber to Universal.",1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0.3001,awful hotel fact call hotel extremely generous initial room ground floor window open directly pool area want natural light room expose room anyone pool area glass tint outside addition room door open straight parking lot easily accessible street do not feel safe penultimate night stay roof one bed begin drip profusely fairness ramada soon issue raise move new room however hotel full happen check time ie 3 pm therefore repack bag leave hotel day pick bag immediately repack departure bathroom terrible shower head 2 foot height bathroom fan floor be not mop clean necessary give dilapidate shower curtain half stay hot water lukewarm water room fridge reek heavily chlorine clean pool water bed do not real pillow three half pillow type one might place decoration sofa masquerade real one advertise fast wifi complete fallacy internet slow take 15 minute load standard website also continually drop require sign include breakfast nothing bread hard boil egg make waffle serve polystyrene plate paper cup awful coffee bus service local attraction could list inconvenient time give people stay dump disney world universal three service 7 11 12 simply good enough either require early wake departure late waste half day end pay 50 day uber park first night ramada number advertising pamphlet slip door local pizza restaurant turn scam order get credit card detail luckily scamme however find scam another hotel guest ramada raise obvious security question pamphlet get slip door hotel aware inform guest happen top departure lovely surprise greet bill 2 night tax utilise safe room hotel cheap charge store valuable safely summary option steer clear joint cost say cheap you re come park you re go spend time anyway would steer clear place go disney intend use shuttle service however short uber universal

28869,1076,26883,2016-04-10,"I'm giving this hotel 3 stars because I got an incredible price through my vacation club making it equal in price to a very cheap, dingy motel... Had I paid what they're actually asking for on their website it would be 1 star.

First, what was great.  The maid was clearly above and beyond.  Never met her, but the room was always spotless.  The floor clean enough you could walk on it barefoot without ickyness.  3/4 of my family thought the beds were very comfortable which is good enough for me.  The continental breakfast was everything you would expect from a continental breakfast and the staff in there were very nice.

What wasn't so ""hot"", pun intentional, was the pool area.  It closes at dusk... So if you're traveling to Orlando for the reason most of us are going in Fall, Winter, or Spring- then don't expect to actually be able to use the pool even if you leave Universal early just to be able to swim!  We did get 15 mins out of 4 days in the pool, which was very cold and the hot tub was affectionately called by all the kids in the pool area the ""not hot"" tub because it was freezing all 4 days.  There hasn't been any rain to cool it down.  They advertise a pool on the roof but you can't get to it with a normal hotel key.

In general, the hotel room was in a bad state of repair.  The bathroom fan didn't work.  The lock on the door was hanging on by loose screws.  MOST importantly, was the hair dryer which, I didn't see until too late, was missing the whole back fan cover so when I flipped over to dry my hair- the exposed fan blade cut off A FOOT long locke of my HAIR!  I complained 3 days in a row and never got a new hairdryer- soaking wet hair everyday at Universal or going to dinner.

Like I said, I got a really really good price on this room so it was worth it- especially since we were barely in the room- but it is not worth the full price!!!",3,-1,-1,1,1,1,0.9862,I m give hotel 3 star get incredible price vacation club make equal price cheap dingy motel pay they re actually ask website would 1 star first great maid clearly beyond never meet room always spotless floor clean enough could walk barefoot without ickyness 34 family think bed comfortable good enough continental breakfast everything would expect continental breakfast staff nice be not hot pun intentional pool area close dusk you re travel orlando reason we go fall winter spring do not expect actually able use pool even leave universal early able swim get 15 min 4 day pool cold hot tub affectionately call kid pool area hot tub freeze 4 day have not rain cool advertise pool roof can not get normal hotel key general hotel room bad state repair bathroom fan do not work lock door hang loose screw importantly hair dryer do not see late miss whole back fan cover flip dry hair expose fan blade cut foot long locke hair complain 3 day row never get new hairdryer soak wet hair everyday universal go dinner like say get really really good price room worth especially since barely room worth full price

The pool was a little smaller than I expected but it was never crowded. Our room was very clean and offered a beautuful lake/city veiw. Overall we enjoyed our visit. I only have 3 complaints which are minor as I would definately stay at the Ramada again if we revisit Orlando in the future. 1) Our jetted tub didn't work which maintenance came and fixed. They did leave the tub a mess and afterwards black disgusting stuff started coming out the jets. I addressed it with the front desk and they handled it well. 2) club level guest were offered unlimited drinks at the skybar...if you're a beer drinker then maybe this is a perk for you but the wine was very cheap that the taste was horrible  3) breakfast was a bit disappointing, selections were limited to waffle, bread, muffins, cereal, grits, oatmeal and yogurt but no eggs, bacon, sausage ECT.

28872,1076,26886,2018-10-16,"It's fine - pretty much exactly what I'd expect from a budget I-Drive hotel. When you're in the theme parks all day then all I really need from a hotel in I-drive is a comfortable room to sleep in. The front desk staff were always friendly and courteous. It was comfortable and the room was cleaned daily (although I'm not sure how throughly as I did find quite a big hair on the side of the bath). On the whole it had reliable WiFi although you do have to keep signing into it. Despite paying for Club level however I didn't get put into a club level room (these were marked as 9-11th floor) but was in the North (newer) tower. I don't know if a Club suite would have been any different to the room I got and I didn't really have time to make use of the Sky bar (they advertise that appetisers are available but they stop serving at 6:15 and the bar closes at 8). I do also like that it is a contained hotel with interior corridors because lots of hotels in I-drive at this price point have a very motel feel.

The suite was big and had everything you'd need - coffee maker, fridge, microwave  and even a hob, sofa (with pull-out sofa bed), TV, en suite bathroom and two double beds. Air con worked great (much needed in Orlando!) Coffee did get replenished daily but the bottled water was more hit and miss. There is a safe in the room but you are charged $2.13 a night to use (that was the only extra fee that was charged).

In the North Tower breakfast was kind of what you'd expect for a complimentary breakfast - cereals, fruit juices, waffles, bread and toast, small selection of pastries, sometimes yoghurt, oatmeal and usually a hot option (boiled eggs most days). There was champagne too. It's functional but not really special and did get a bit boring after a couple of weeks. It's all packed with refined sugar and I would definitely have liked some  protein options even if it was just some cold meats. Even though you're on holiday you should try to go for breakfast before 8 o'clock - every time I went after 8.30 it was heaving, no tables and there was a long line for everything. If you can sit outside at breakfast it is lovely as you get a gorgeous view over the lake.

A word of warning about the shuttles because this was the main reason I chose this hotel. Unreliable and inconvenient is my best description. The Disney shuttle goes at 7:20, 10:35 and 12:30 (which are awkward times). The Universal shuttle is at 9:20 and the Sea World one at 12:35 (again, incredibly inconvenient time). The bus itself looked and felt old and there often was only standing room. On two days the 07:20 shuttle turned up over 20 minutes late (one time I was leaving the hotel at around 07:40 and the Disney bus crowd were still waiting), the one time I tried the Universal shuttle it didn't show at all in both directions and trying to use the the Sea World shuttle to go back to the hotel I gave up waiting after 20 minutes after the posted pick up time and took the trolley (despite always being at the pickup point 15 minutes early as requested). There is no way to reserve the shuttle (the only one that needs reservation is the 10:30 Disney) so there really is no guaranteeing if there is even going to be space for everyone.

I wish the hotel would use a better shuttle provider because that would definitely influence my decision to stay here again. Be prepared to use taxis a lot - I did become really dependent on Lyft whilst I was here for getting to the theme parks. Universal looks really close on the map (some sources advertise it as being about a mile) but it's closer to 1.5 miles and, bear in mind that you'll be a doing a lot of walking during the day!

The other main downside is that there is no restaurant or room service in the resort. It wasn't an advertised feature but I often didn't want to go out looking for a restaurant after being on my feet all day and really would have liked the option to stay in the hotel. There are a few restaurants around the hotel but I did notice that there is a much bigger selection about a mile further south on I drive.",3,0,1,1,-1,0,0.9901,fine pretty much exactly I d expect budget idrive hotel you re theme park day really need hotel idrive comfortable room sleep front desk staff always friendly courteous comfortable room clean daily although I m sure throughly find quite big hair side bath whole reliable wifi although keep sign despite pay club level however do not get put club level room mark 911th floor north new tower do not know club suite would different room get do not really time make use sky bar advertise appetiser available stop serve 615 bar close 8 also like contain hotel interior corridor lot hotel idrive price point motel feel suite big everything you d need coffee maker fridge microwave even hob sofa pullout sofa bed tv en suite bathroom two double bed air con work great much need orlando coffee get replenish daily bottled water hit miss safe room charge 213 night use extra fee charge north tower breakfast kind you d expect complimentary breakfast cereal fruit juice waffle bread toast small selection pastry sometimes yoghurt oatmeal usually hot option boil egg day champagne functional really special get bit boring couple week pack refined sugar would definitely like protein option even cold meat even though you re holiday try go breakfast 8 oclock every time go 830 heaving table long line everything sit outside breakfast lovely get gorgeous view lake word warn shuttle main reason choose hotel unreliable inconvenient good description disney shuttle go 720 1035 1230 awkward times universal shuttle 920 sea world one 1235 incredibly inconvenient time bus looked feel old often stand room two day 0720 shuttle turn 20 minute late one time leave hotel around 0740 disney bus crowd still wait one time try universal shuttle do not show direction try use sea world shuttle go back hotel give wait 20 minute post pick time take trolley despite always pickup point 15 minute early request way reserve shuttle one need reservation 1030 disney really guarantee even go space everyone wish hotel would use well shuttle provider would definitely influence decision stay prepared use taxi lot become really dependent lyft whilst get theme park universal look really close map source advertise mile close 15 mile bear mind you ll lot walk day main downside restaurant room service resort be not advertise feature often do not want go look restaurant foot day really would liked option stay hotel restaurant around hotel notice much big selection mile south drive

Breakfast is served 6.30-9.30 and if you go after 8 you havent a chance of getting waffles. They take 2 and half minutes to cook and there is a queue of 15 people at least. 3 machines. The location is amazing. Walkable distance to universal studios, which i suggest doing, as the free bus gets you there around 10 and is often late. The rides have long wait times by then. There is also a free bus to disney and sea life. But be aware..! The return journey is a massive struggle as the bus is filled to the brim from disney. If you have young kids, could be a problem. The staff are kind enough. No problems there. And the cleaners do a real good job. There are no balconies in any rooms. And the pool is small but adequate.

28903,1076,26917,2017-05-26,"Upon our first arrival at the hotel, everything seemed great. Check in was fast and once up in our rooms, they were nice and clean. However there were many bumps throughout our stay. You need to use your room key to use the elevator, which is fine, if it worked. Everytime we tried to use our key on the elevator, it would not work and we had to get our key redone. No matter how many times we told them the issues with our key, they would only work for that first ride on the elevator.
Breakfast was on the 2nd floor, which was a nightmare. We always tried to use our key to get to the 2nd floor but ended up having to once again go and get the key redone. After the first time we had troubles with our key, we tried using the stairs, if anything surely the stairs would be an option to avoid the elevator/key nonsense. However this is not an option unless you want to get out on floor 4, 6, 8, or 10. All of the other floors have no handle or are locked. So not only did our key not work in the elevator but now we can't get out on the floor where breakfast was and we were staying on the 7th floor. After a full day outside at Universal park, which is near by, we were trying to get up to our room. Of course the elevator failed to let us use it so we went to the front desk to redo our key, again. That morning we had no problem getting our key redone, but for some reason this time there were a million question involved, like we were on trial for our key not working. One of the front desk workers even told us to ""try playing with the key to get the elevator to work."" Coming to the front desk was our last resort, of course we tried the elevator first because just that morning when trying to get to breakfast we had our key redone.
After all of the work that goes into trying to get to breakfast, it was a poor selection of food. They have some bread and bagels, only one choice for both of those. Some gross looking fruit cocktail out of a can and a waffle station are all that were provided to use during our stay. On the sheet they gave us at check in they ranted and raved about their breakfast including champagne and being AMAZING but it was lackluster and we ended up buy food elsewhere.
The maids that cleaned our room would take our towels we hung up and not replace them. I understand the policy that if our towels are on the floor, that's a sign that we want new ones, but our towels were hung up on the rack, isn't that a sign that we are okay with using the same towel? And how come the maid took the towels but never gave us new ones?
The one thing that was a signing light during our stay was how close we were to Universal. The only thing is that shuttle only has one pick up time to the parks and back. I understand going there, most people are wide awake and ready to spend their time at the park. However, only having one shuttle at 6pm heading back to the hotel seems like a bad choice. People are bound to be tired and not very willing to walk back to the hotel. I'm not sure if this is solely the hotel's doing or if they have a contract with a different company for shuttles, but it is something they need to reconsider.",2,-1,0,-1,-1,-1,-0.92,upon first arrival hotel everything seem great check fast room nice clean however many bump throughout stay need use room key use elevator fine work everytime try use key elevator would work get key redone matter many time tell issue key would work first ride elevator breakfast 2nd floor nightmare always try use key get 2nd floor end go get key redone first time trouble key try use stair anything surely stair would option avoid elevatorkey nonsense however option unless want get floor 4 6 8 10 floor handle lock key work elevator can not get floor breakfast stay 7th floor full day outside universal park near try get room course elevator fail let we use go front desk redo key morning problem get key redone reason time million question involve like trial key work one front desk worker even tell we try play key get elevator work come front desk last resort course try elevator first morning try get breakfast key redone work go try get breakfast poor selection food bread bagel one choice gross look fruit cocktail waffle station provide use stay sheet give we check rant rave breakfast include champagne amazing lackluster end buy food elsewhere maid clean room would take towel hung replace understand policy towel floor that s sign want new one towel hung rack be not sign okay use towel come maid take towel never give we new one one thing sign light stay close universal thing shuttle one pick time park back understand go people wide awake ready spend time park however one shuttle 6 pm head back hotel seem like bad choice people bind tired willing walk back hotel I m sure solely hotel contract different company shuttle something need reconsider

The next morning i went to the front desk and was then again advised my package was not there, after 20 mins spent waiting for the package, it was found.

The area is in the back of a building in the service area. The elevators feel like service elevators and one has been out of order for months. Rooms are not clean. They are musty and the bathroom are dirty. The carpet seems at least 50 years old and overall very outdated. The so called “continental breakfast” is cheap waffles, pancakes and bread. All carbs.

28909,1076,26923,2019-06-05,"I never normally write a review because I believe that we can all have our bad days but I do always compliment staff verbally when it is good also but my first day went from bad to worse at this hotel so when booking please be aware should you need help from a manager your not likely to get it. On arrival my son on I were greeted very politely & was told our room number & given access cards & pointed in the direction we should go whilst getting our belongings together I noticed another couple also checking who was given the full run down about the hotels facilities & given wi-fi password I thought why didn’t I but left it as I am a big boy now & can navigate my own way around. I was given room 413 on entry I had a great view overlooking the adjacent lake which I could just about make out through the cobwebs & dirt on the windows I then made my way into the bathroom as this is the first place I always check for cleanliness when I stay at hotels to my sheer disgust I found an unmissable long black hair I then inspected the floor to find numerous amounts of hair scattered all over the place & to top it all off pubic hairs also. I immediately went down to reception & asked for the manager which I was told he or she was not available till 9am the next day. Now I had arrived at the hotel roughly 6;30 pm so I thought okay I can wait till in the morning to speak to the manager as I had been travelling for over 12 hours & just wanted to get my son fed & settled down for the night but I was not prepared to settle down in the room they had given me for the obvious reasons. I was then given another room on the 6th floor 603 or 610 so entering this room with having OCD I carried out the same inspection & again to my sheer disgust was the same problem like the first room I took photographs just to prove my point should I be asked the question by reception staff which I never was so again I had to go down to complain about this room. I was very polite as I believe you can make your point in the right manner without getting aggressive or angry I was told to wait whilst the room was inspected for over 15 minutes with my son who had also travelled from Philadelphia to meet me as I reside in the UK & we only get to see each other once a year I then offered a solution to the guy when he finally reappeared from the back of reception to upgrade me & I will happily contribute providing it was a reasonable price as I don’t expect it to be free even though part of me feels it was the least they could do. Finally I was given another room 201 maybe he has upgraded for free NOT a chance instead I did not have the nice lake view but a view of the side of the hotel & pool area aka no privacy whatsoever not only for ourselves but also pool attendees so bookers be aware but I really do hope this review puts you off staying here okay for a night maybe providing you don’t mind hairs from every part of some strangers body everywhere that is but definitely not for a vacation, by this time it was getting close to 9pm at night so I took the room fed my son & reluctantly settled down for the night with the thought of speaking with the manager first thing in the morning. 9.30 am the next day at reception I asked to speak to the manager to be told they are on vacation WOW the day before I was told by 2 members of staff a manager would be available to speak with patiently I asked to speak with the next person in charge maybe a supervisor I suggested again to my surprise I was greeted with a vacant look I then had to explain to a different member of staff my whole story upon arrival & again I asked if I could be upgraded “Certainly Sir that will be an additional $2000 plus dollars you have got to be joking for all that inconvenience again politely I declined he then asked me to come back in an hour & he will see what he can do.

The air conditioning was VERY noisy.  The rooms are tired and showing signs of decades of neglect.

There is a shuttle service to the parks, but certainly for a Universal Studios, Island of Adventure and Volcano Bay, I’d recommend Uber for convenience and flexibility.

Ramada REALLY need to wise up to its environmental responsibilities. Polystyrene and plastic disposable cups, crockery and utensils for the breakfast service in this day and age?! Shocking (as was the standard of the breakfast offering).

The draft beer at the bar was actually very good value compared to surrounding bars at $4.

28944,1076,26958,2015-08-17,"I stay in Orlando 3 out of 4 weekends, and we love to check out new hotels.  For some reason I didn't read the reviews before booking this hotel (which were all spot on).  I guess I saw rooftop pool and liked the club level suite options.  The suite and club level floors were great, the hotel did give me check in at 12 like I asked, (though most hotels do).  Where they fall short is holding the Ramada name but it is a franchise that can do what they want.  Pool closes at 8:30.  I didn't realize how horrible that is until this hotel.  Spending the day in Orlando then wanting to come back and hit the pool and spa.  I have stayed in just about every hotel on I-drive and have never come across this.  Technically pools are only open dusk til dawn, who wants to really use the spa in the middle of the day.  They say they close the pool early because there are rooms behind it, however those rooms had no lights on at 9:30pm.  Probably out enjoying Orlando or trying to use the pool like us.  Why were out there talking with security, 4 more groups of people came out trying to use the pool.  Two more groups up to the front counter in bath suites asking why the gates were locked.  No one expected that.  The only reason I booked the suite was because of the Club Level and access to the roof top bar and pool.  It comes with free beer and wine from 12 to 8pm.  Which I thought great, after 8 we can just bring a couple drinks from the room and sit in the spa and watch the sunset.  Everything locks at 8pm, you can not access that area after 8!  What a joke and they do not tell you that at all.  Lobby bar is joke, breakfast is a joke, roof top is a joke, staff is a joke, business center is a joke, couldn't find the game room for the kids.  The things that made this place appealing are ripped from you way to early especially when its location is right in the middle of I-drive.  There is so much to walk to and then come back to everything that is closed and a rude staff behind the counter.  One elevator was broke with no sign, so everyone would pile in front of both, took 10 minutes to get to 9th floor, because of the line to fit in the 1 elevator.  It was not until I said something they put a sign up.  Don't think to say lets just use the stairs... Oddly setup and not all floors have handles to enter from stairwell.  Just all around a disappointment.  Hotel is not setup for the customer, it's setup to profit, lights in room do not turn on unless your room key is put in the slot, after the horrible service I just left the second key in the slot in the room, All amenities shut down way to early, they don't serve liquor at the bar so I assume they saved by only having the beer and wine license?

28973,1076,26987,2017-08-31,"During October/November last year, I visited this place with my family during our trip to the USA. The location was perfect near Disney World, Universal Studios etc. but the hotel itself was anything but good (and disgusting).

Let's start with the bad but still managable stuff: The breakfast was cheap and not at all like what the picture on their website says, as they only served old fruits, cereal, waffles, dry bread, and some kind of donut pressed into a ball (?) When we also came to our hotelroom the first night it wasn't cleaned very well, as I found a couple of hair strands in the beds. Also, we didn't have a chance to try the pool, but it seemed quite dirty.

Now to the horrible and disgusting thing that happened: One night my mom went to the bathroom and when she flushed the toilet, it became clogged. Sure, I know it happens, but then the toilet water started to rise and guess what, something came up from the toilet. Namely poop. Yup, someone else's poop from the other rooms had come to our room and started to float in the rising water of our toilet! Then as you probably can imagine, the water spilled onto the floor along with the stranger's poop. Thankfully we called them and they got it fixed, but it was still horribly disgusting (and a funny story to tell afterwards).

But moral of the story: I wouldn't recommend this (budget) hotel. Try to find something else while you still can :)",1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-0.9808,octobernovember last year visit place family trip usa location perfect near disney world universal studio etc hotel anything good disgusting let start bad still managable stuff breakfast cheap like picture website say serve old fruit cereal waffle dry bread kind donut press ball also come hotelroom first night be not clean well find couple hair strand bed also do not chance try pool seem quite dirty horrible disgusting thing happen one night mom go bathroom flush toilet become clog sure know happen toilet water start rise guess something come toilet namely poop yup someone else poop room come room start float rise water toilet probably imagine water spill onto floor along stranger poop thankfully call got fix still horribly disgusting funny story tell afterwards moral story would not recommend budget hotel try find something else still

The elevator didn't work. We had to go back inside to tell them, and they told us they knew and that the maintenance guy would be by sometime to let us up. If they knew, why wouldn't they tell us? How is it okay for us to just stand there outside in the night waiting for an unknown person to arrive at an unspecified time to let us up?

Here is exactly how I would describe the STANDARD room. I didn’t expect much because I’m not that fussed, however I didn’t expect this.
Open the door to your room and immediately wind your watch back to the 1970’s. I expected peter Faulkner (columbo) to knock the door and tell me “there’s just one more question sir”
Everything from the vile curtains and carpet scream “storage locker furniture”. The microwave didn’t work because the lead didn’t reach the extension cord but that didn’t bother be as I had no use for it anyway but whoever put this here must have been aware just simply didn’t care.
Housekeeping was awful and most days left us with no toilet paper and when I did call down to reception to ask for some, some bad attitude b&%ch turned up chewing gum and begrudgingly handed me the bog roll, oh I’m sorry for needing to wipe my arse lady, F%* you too.   I chose to drive down to wall mart and purchase my own rather than face lady attitude again.
The plug sockets are so worn anything that you plug in falls straight back out.
This side of the ramada is a sh^% hole. Its like a load of really crappy motels stacked on top of each other, and I’ve stayed at the econolodge on the p.c.h. at long beach california so that is saying something.
If you do decide to stay here after reading this then fair play to you but do bring your own toilet paper.
Oh credit where its due though the cable tv channels aren’t bad. You got all the good ones A&E, AMC, History, discovery etc….   (over 30 odd) so well done for that, and only that, that’s all though.
Oh, it’s the first time I’ve ever been charged for using the security safe when I checked out, so that was a nice surprise.

29393,811,27407,2023-07-26,"This is a story.

I hated the location, honestly, I'm shocked my truck didn't get broken into.

We had to repeatedly switch rooms. We were 2 hours past the earliest check in.

The 1st room given to us wasn't even ready. The maid was still cleaning it. So we got another room. The 2nd room given to us was not properly cleaned and it look like someone was using the room earlier because there was feces in the toilet and it was backed up. Overall, I found the room small, outdated and a bit depressing. We were ready to leave and go elsewhere. However the host at the register was SUPER GENEROUS and gave us the Mack suit on the top floor at no extra charge!!!

It was a nice room to say, it had a bar and a mini fridge. There were 3 working AC units, and the room was HUGE and the bed was super comfortable, and the view was adequate. Well, to me at least. The windows could use replacing.

I personally didn't care to much for the bathroom layout.. the light switches where confusing and for some reason the room phone is next to the toilet and the toilet is in a closet. Every air vent needed cleaning, they didn't vaccuum under the couch, (we had to move it so we could watch TV without hurting our necks) and there was 1 light switch that didn't seem to do anything. However, over the other 2 rooms it was nice enough, so we stayed there for the night. Although it did suck waking up at 6:30 in the morning because of the machinery being used across the street.

I don't think I would stay here again to be honest, I just didn't like the place.

when it came to our room, we immediately found that our bathroom light didn't work and within 5 minutes, there was a maintenance man who came to fix a problem with the toilet? must have been the previous guests, but what a start. the view was decent, if you didn't mind the yelling or hourly sirens (that's more reno than the hotel though). the bed and bathroom were decent as well. our entire 4 night stay as well included NO housekeeper! not once did anyone come in, even if only for fresh towels.

there was no mention or sign for a pool, despite being advertised online, and there was a restaurant that was also never open?

29417,811,27431,2023-04-22,"I don’t write a lot of reviews but I thought that this place needed to be reviewed to keep people from making the same mistake that I did by staying here. I would say that this was one of the top 3 worst hotels that I have stayed at.
- They advertise free Wi-Fi but it barely works. I am traveling for business and I depend on the Wi-Fi to be able to work in my room. The Wi-Fi was to slow to even get my email to update, never mind a video call.
- The first room that we were given had not been cleaned yet, so we had to wait in line to get a new room.
- I had to get new keys everyday because they stopped working everyday. After a long day at work the last thing I wanted to do was stand in line at the front desk to get new keys.
- There is water damage all over the room. In general, the maintenance of the facility is poor. It is outdated and run down.
- There are not enough plugs in the room and the ones that there are, are not conveniently located.
- I called for housekeeping to bring more toiletries they did not show up, so back to the long line at the front desk.

The staff was very pleasant. There is just not enough of them. There was always a line at the front desk. Every time I went there, there was only one person working. I know that I am kind of spoiled because I travel a lot and stay in many different hotels. On top of that, I worked at 2 different 4 diamond resorts for almost 25 years. I know what a good hotel is suppose to look like. This place has so much potential but it seems the owners of this place are unwilling to put any money into this place.

Not a quiet hotel by any stretch of the imagination, two blocks from a train line and under a flight path. Sadly out of date and looking its last total overhaul was 40 years ago. The room description on Hotels.com included a fridge and microwave, which were not in our room. Also ""the TVs pretty much don't work"" (words of the desk staff); clear picture from local broadcast channels, but everything else was static and distorted.

Given the state of the hotel, I removed the sheets to check how clean the mattress was. Sooo relieved to see it was in a pristine state. However, it was also an outdated spring mattress, and was only made up with a thin blanket. No spares in the room either; you'll have to crank up the noisy wall heater unit before bed if it's any kind of cold outside.

The shower takes water efficiency to a ridiculous level. Couldn't even hear the water running from outside the bathroom. Takes a good while to get clean with only a dozen needle streams coming at you. It was, however, clean and free of rust or paint chips.

Unsurprisingly for a Nevada casino- hotel, the lobby wreaks of cigarettes, but you can't smell it up on the upper hotel floors. I can't imagine eating the complimentary breakfast in that environment though.

The room's redeeming factor was that the room and linens were clean.

29536,811,27550,2020-02-10,"The Reno Ramada is a genuine hole. Do not stay here. The lobby smells like an ashtray, but that's the least of the problems. The rooms are full of old light fixtures that may or may not function, furniture with disturbing stains, and ZERO amenities. No mini-fridge for leftovers. No takeout menus. But it gets so much worse than that.

They don't clean the rooms while you're there. They claim it's green, but I think it's just a way for them to save on personnel costs by cutting housekeeping jobs. At least they offer to help when you need it, but when I did call down to the front desk for fresh towels, the clerk rudely told me I could come down and get them myself. I had to haul down my dirties from the 10th floor while wearing my sweaty workout clothes and wait for a new set before I could shower.

You'd think without housekeeping service, you'd at least get some peace and privacy, but at one point during my stay someone came in and made the bed without being asked, and another time someone came knocking to clean--at 7 am!

The shower, of course, had deeply-set dirt stuck to the pan along with a disturbing dirty drip or two on the tiles. This was a last-minute emergency trip for me, so I had to use the hotel soap, among other things (watered-down shampoo and conditioner). It burned my skin. After that I bought some cleanser, but for the remainder of my four-day trip, I had rough red spots on my face.

I had to use the room blow dryer for my hair, but it somehow overheated and fried a chunk of my hair off. Yes, I've used plenty of dryers and blown out my hair hundreds of times. In years of heat styling, I've never burnt hair until this trip.

There's no reason to ever stay here. Don't do it to yourself.

Yes, it’s in a area of town that is not the best.  There are a lot of rundown properties around but I felt safe.  The folks staying there looked to be a mix of traveling families and people in town for gambling.
They had 2 security guards frequently walking the property and I did not see any problems.  It has a very small casino attached to it that I would avoid. I walked through on Saturday night and it was full with folks I wouldn’t want to have dinner with.  From most peoples appearance I wondered how they could afford to gamble.
From the reviews it seems one of the main complaints is the smoke smell from the casino which permeates the lobby when you walk in.  I suppose they make $$ on the casino and need to keep it open.
The room was very clean.  No spots on carpet, no mold in shower and the bed was comfortable.  The only issue with the room was the TV was an old tube style with a terrible picture but it did have a lot of channels to choose from including showtime.

Because of the winds, the heater was ineffective at best, reaching a cool 50 degrees in there room, while constantly howling throughout the night. I ended up using a decibel meter to find out how loud it actually say. On average, it was 75 decibels. At minimum, 65 decibels. At maximum, 85 decibels. Let's put that in to perspective: 60 decibels is normal conversation volume. 75 decibels is the volume of an average vacuum. 85 decibels is the sound of an average gas-powered lawnmower. Now imagine that happening all night. All of that combined: hard beds, a severe lack of insulation or heat, thin blankets, old CRT TVs that emit a high pitched whine, thin walls, I had maybe 2 hours of sleep that was broken up by the constant noise and discomfort.

The rooms are also excellent, plenty of room with two queen beds, storage (even umberella's to use if you need), a bit of paint loss around door frames etc. but otherwise impeccable, bathroom was super clean and tidy.  We also attended the free wine and music hour (twice a week) which was a lovely free addition and we had the free breakfast to go each morning which was more than sufficient and really tasty (a yummy bacon, egg and cheese muffin or egg, onion and cheese muffin plus a freshly baked croissant and a hot or cold drink).

30385,1328,28399,2023-07-26,"This was my 3rd time to Manhattan from San Diego and my 3rd hotel. 
Hotel Edison was by far the best overall! You cannot beat the convenient location (steps from the TKTS ticket windows and red stairs in Times Square) and the included breakfast options. 
Instead of a typical breakfast buffet, we were given tickets to choose either sit-down ($5 extra) or grab n go at 3 different nearby restaurants. We chose the grab n go at Carve for our 4 mornings and loved their 11 breakfast choices plus OJ or coffee. They served hot breakfast and we were given the choices to eat there or take the items to go. We always ate there. 
The lobby is nice with a large waiting room perfect if you arrive too early for the check in or have a flight later than the noon check out. For $1 per bag, you can store your bags for the day. The staff is very nice. 
The hallways on the floors are large but the actual queen room I shared with my daughter was rather small. That’s very typical in NY. There was a small frig (make sure to plug it in), small bathroom (smelled of mildew/mold hence the 4 stars for cleanliness), enough floor space to put a large suitcase opened on the floor and a large closet. The bed was comfortable. 
I will definitely return to Hotel Edison.",5,1,0,1,-1,1,0.9729,3rd time manhattan san diego 3rd hotel hotel edison far good overall beat convenient location step tkts ticket window red stairs times square include breakfast option instead typical breakfast buffet give ticket choose either sitdown 5 extra grab n go 3 different nearby restaurant choose grab n go carve 4 morning love 11 breakfast choice plus oj coffee serve hot breakfast give choice eat take item go always eat lobby nice large waiting room perfect arrive early check flight later noon check 1 per bag store bag day staff nice hallway floor large actual queen room share daughter rather small that s typical ny small frig make sure plug small bathroom smell mildewmold hence 4 star cleanliness enough floor space put large suitcase open floor large closet bed comfortable definitely return hotel edison

Walkable to everything we wanted to see.  close to restaurants, shops, broadway, Central Park  and the subway located  just steps away in Times Square. The check in  & checkout  was easy and friendly. The lobby staff always pleasant and attentive. The grab and go breakfast was a nice perk to start your day. We did encounter some issues with unfriendly staff the last day at the grab and go breakfast station but otherwise all staff we encountered during our stay were pleasant and professional. The rooms were spacious, clean, quiet & perfect temperature. Beds were comfy.  The accessible shower was a bit hard to get used to as it flooded the bathroom due to no door- but easy fix with towels! On our final night my daughters and I were returning from evening of sightseeing and we got stuck in elevator- after about 15 minutes we were rescued. The security and lobby staff were so concerned and helpful. Very attentive to us and making sure we were ok.

Super shady area.Should've known this right away as there were several cop cars across the street (#2&3 red flags) and lots of randos roaming around the property when we pulled up to the front for check in.
NEVER had to write a review like this where I used up all of the available characters but wanted to give as much details as possible so you don't make the same mistake of booking this hotel.Honestly feel bad for the workers having to deal with unhappy guests.  The young guy at the front desk (night shift) seemed uneasy checking us in as if we weren't at the right place and telling us doors are locked at 10pm. The 4th red flag within minutes of arriving. Smelled of nasty smoke/old building. We were exhausted& figured ehhh we need sleep after on the road for 8 hours. Carpet stains everywhere. Shower-no pressure.

Also the room says a double bed room- which most stays are double Queen beds, but these beds are maybe a full at best, and the room is extremely small so you’re very close to the other bed - which made for a slightly awkward hotel stay for all of us. 
Also the restaurant that is “24 hours” attached to the hotel is no longer 24/hrs, and although it’s a hotel restaurant, the hotel didn’t know what their new hours were. 
Also the hotel room did not have a microwave so that a was a bummer too for how much is was per night. The TV also wouldn’t turn up volume wise and kept glitching out while we were trying to watch a show.

Washing machine doesn't work well, didn't dissolve most of the detergent which then was on my clothes.

For this price, certainly the worst place I've ever been in

None of the outlets work so we went to Disney with no phones because of this. So no pictures were taken during our vacation. The only outlets that worked were currently in use and hidden by furniture. Therefor, once again, no phones, no watches, and no portable DVD players for the ride home. 
Carpet desperately needs replacing, concrete floor was showing where seams of carpet are, including door frames. Stains all over the place. There were handprints all over the headboards of the beds. The beds were so worn you could feel every spring in it. Towels had pubic hairs all over them. Not to mention the millions of hairs all over the bathroom.

First, I booked a lakefront room. What we got was a room overlooking the parking lot. When I inquired, I was told rooms are not guaranteed and they currently had nothing lakefront.  I was also told they were booked that weekend, which was untrue since I could go online and book a supposed lakefront room. So, be aware, you don’t always get what you paid for.  (They did offer to switch our room about 4 days into our stay, but by then it wasn’t worth the switch). 
Second, they have reduced the “free” breakfast choices to prepackaged danishes, granola bars, wrapped apples/oranges and beverages.  We ended up having to go out to breakfast most mornings.
Third, something not mentioned on their website, the free shuttle to Universal was not happening. We booked this stay to be close to Universal and have a free ride. Instead, we paid $26 a day to park because we had to drive ourselves.

On the positive side, the pool and hot tub were great. If you’re looking for tanning time, you need to get up early. The pool area gets morning sun only, which was great for me since I’m more of a hot tub girl. No sun in the afternoon kept the area cooler.

31991,1076,30005,2021-06-08,"We stayed here while going to Universal Orlando. The hotel does NOT have a shuttle. However it was a fairly easy one-mile walk. We were hot and sweaty, though, even at 8 am. 

The hotel had plenty of parking and the lot seemed safe.

The outside of the hotel is a bit shabby but the lobby is very nice. Lots of places to sit and talk. The back of the hotel sits on the bank of a lake and the pool and jacuzzi overlook this nice scenery. 

We checked in late due to being at Universal all day and they gave us a room on the 6th floor that was 87 degrees and the AC didn’t work. When we let them know, they changed us to a room on the 8th floor and told us we were lucky because the 8th floor and above are for their premium customers. Apparently they have an exclusive bar and pool on the roof of the hotel that only some people get access to. But we didn’t feel lucky. We didn’t get access and, more importantly, the room was filthy. The beds were fine but the living area was not. The sofa was so dirty and stained that we put one of the covers over it so we wouldn’t have to touch it with our bodies. The carpet was torn and stained. The walls and fixtures all had grey fingerprint smudges all over them and the walls and furniture were all scuffed up.

Now here is where the cheap comes in.

4. There was not even one bottle of water in the room for coffee, water had to be purchased at the front desk. 
5. there was supposed to be a restaurant in the hotel open for breakfast (which was one of the main reasons why I chose it since I was traveling with a 1yr old) and it turns out the breakfast place didnt open on tuesdays and wednesdays... 
6.

Secondly, the toilet was leaning. You can’t make this up.

I requested another room. They had me go back up to the front desk where the two front desk ladies were EATING ICE CREAM BARS! While eating the ice cream, the girl asked what room I was in again… then gave me a new room. New room was HOT. The poor little air conditioning unit was working so hard just to keep going. The room was not in great condition but a huge step from the last one I had been in. I didn’t want to be difficult and accepted the room.

The new rooms toilet didn’t work! It just went around and around ans the water kept rising and I was scared to use it again bc it never went back down. 

I had to take the 4:30am shuttle. The only good thing about this place was that they had an early shuttle and the guy who drove the shuttle was VERY friendly and seemed like a good guy.

The hotel. No… it needs to be fully renovated by some deep pocket investors. The current situation looks like they are doing a little at a time.

The only reasons I can’t give it a full 5 stars is because it did have somewhat thin ceilings and windows...we could pretty easily hear our neighbors walking around upstairs and there was a fair but not awful amount of traffic noise during the day from Wilshire Blvd. The neighborhood gets pretty quiet at night though, so getting sleep wasn’t a problem. The wallpaper and some of the bathroom fixtures were a bit tired, but overall we had exceptionally nice rooms (we stayed twice on the same trip) for the price point in a great neighborhood of a pretty expensive city—and my wife and I would definitely stay here again.",5,1,1,1,1,0,0.9913,clean spacious room good heatercooler perfectly hot shower convenient parking security guard great wifi good service hotel fantastic westside location western edge koreatown walkable near purple line subway station get downtown hollywood also within 15 minute la brea tar pit lacma original farmer market grove cbs television city reason can not give full 5 star somewhat thin ceiling windowswe could pretty easily hear neighbor walk around upstairs fair awful amount traffic noise day wilshire blvd neighborhood get pretty quiet night though get sleep be not problem wallpaper bathroom fixture bit tired overall exceptionally nice room stay twice trip price point great neighborhood pretty expensive cityand wife would definitely stay

A couple of things that could have improved: 

- Hotel room was fairly clean but I did notice that there was old gum stuck on the headboard of the room that wasn't cleaned/removed. 

- There was a day I had got laundry service and when the laundry was ready, the bell man (older gentleman there) came to deliver it. But I had a ""do not disturb"" sign on my door and he still aggressively banged on my door and then immediately let himself into my room after as soon as 10 seconds. I was not dressed in my room at that time and was fumbling to put on a tshirt quickly but not even enough time to put on pants! Why would he automatically let himself in when my sign is on the door? Let alone, he didn't wait longer then 10 seconds before proceeding to let himself in without warning. 

- On the last day, the SAME gentleman came knocking on my door (even though my do not disturb sign was on). Again scrambling to put on some clothes, this time he did not let himself in but he was asking if I had called bell service - which I did not. This was also another inconvenient disturbance while I was still in bed in the morning. How do you mess up the room number of who called bell service?

The great service continued at check-in where I was greeted with a smile and care. The guy helping me out that night was really really nice! He deserves a raise!

Cons:
The pictures are deceiving, not every room has a balcony or door to the pool. We arrived to find our suite windows opened to a brick wall. So disappointing.
$24 a night for parking, however, it was worth it because it was a safe and convenient parking garage.
Breakfast is very limited (not their fault/COVID)
Common areas are outdated and could use some freshening up.

Parking was a bit of a hassle to get to and spots were limited but it was nice that it wasn't on the busy road. 
There was construction on site and they have you sign off on it at check-in. Initially it didn't seem like a problem and I honestly thought it was the construction next door to the hotel (it was not clearly explained at check-in). Our first morning, there were workers directly outside of our patio doors of our room on the poolside working at about 7am. It was a huge hassle and we did not get to sleep in. Luckily they were not there the next morning. 
We complained about the noise and were told we signed off on construction so we were out of luck. We were compensated in the form of parking fees which was nice but we felt deceived a bit. Had we known the construction would have been right outside our door we would have asked to be moved. 
Other than that our stay was pleasant. The building is a bit old and has an old, musty type of smell despite upgrades etc. The bathroom was nicely updated. The breakfast was very nice with a different menu each morning. We made it to Universal studios in less than 15 minutes which was a bonus.

However, the person that checked us in did not inform us about the resort credit due to my Expedia Gold status, which is a bit of a bummer, because we would have used it, especially also because I asked for the room upgrade, which they were able to accommodate. Our room was nice and clean, and located towards the front of the hotel, facing Sunset Boulevard (North-East corner), and I do have to admit, that the traffic was very loud on that side. The windows are old historical windows, and don't really block the sound too well. Later at night, it finally died down, but then we were woken up early Sunday morning by a concert of dogs barking, which we weren't too happy with. Not the hotels fault, but something to consider for the future. The shower head pressure in the shower was not adjustable, and the water pressure was so strong, that it actually hurt a bit to take a shower. Maybe an adjustable water pressure shower head might be a better option, especially for roughy $400/$500 dollar per night.

We got back and there was still mold cereal under the nightstand but since everything was great, didn’t want to complain anymore, just enjoy.
Checkout was a nightmare. The website says they could extend our checkout to 12:30 and pay $25 after that. My friends left to buy souvenires and we got a call (first time getting a call in my life to do the checkout) and the lady was extremely rude saying we had to leave and there wasn’t extended checkout neither extra fee. I left the room to return the keys while the girls were trying to close their suitcases out of the room and she was very rude saying that we were going to pay extra $75 (when she said there wasn’t extra fee to pay). I complained about the bugs and cereal and she was like: “oh and you just tell me this now??” And I asked her to check the cameras bc I complained 2 days before. How can someone like that work in a hotel from desk? The stay was great if it wasn’t for her. I do not recommend this experience.

After checking in to Rooms 507 and 508, my children observed that a giant 4 foot by 12 foot mirror in their room was a two way mirror. My kid then used a phone flashlight and put it up next to surface, you could see an open area wide enough for a person on the other side of the mirror.  We did not observe any people video recording devices in the space.  Both rooms had the same one-way mirror.  My children were petrified that there could be cameras watching them from behind these. We called Expedia and went to the front desk to get out of this place. 
The bell hop said he could fix it.  When we later returned to the room (our stuff was all there still) - one of the mirrors, was covered up with a makeshift paper cover held up by duct tape.  We didn’t show the bell hop which of the several giant mirrors in the room was two way, he knew.

I was a bit confused by their mask policy, requiring one indoors at all times EXCEPT when in the parlor area where they were hosting a little get-together for guests with food and drink and everyone milling around and talking to each other. So a mask is required when I'm alone in a hallway but not when conversing in tight quarters with 30 strangers? That's confusing.
The printed TV channel guide in the room did not reflect the actual channels in any way and there was no guide in their tv system, so you have to plink through each channel and wait for them to load, very tedious.
Had to pull the cover of the toilet tank to get it to flush the first time, fixed it.
A guest across the hall managed to set off the fire alarm while cooking at 10:45PM. Of course that isn't the hotels fault, but their response certainly is.
I waited in the hallway for the entire fire alarm duration (15-20 minutes) and never once did an employee come to give instructions to anyone.

What we didn't like: The clientele in general was not what we would want to expose our kids to. There was a loud fight in the room right next to ours that lasted on and off for three or more hours. A man and a woman were screaming and yelling profanities at one another and stomping in and out of the room slamming the door. I feared that it was going to get violent and it certainly was something that could be heard throughout the entire floor; but to my knowledge, the hotel did nothing to intervene. Also, we were on the ground floor about five doors down from the exit to the parking lot. People tended to cluster around the door to smoke so the hallway always smelled like smoke, causing me and my kids to cough. It also frequently smelled of marijuana. The folks at the front desk were also apathetic about dealing with issues. When I asked to speak to a manager, they gave me his card and told me to come back in the morning. When I came in the morning, the person at the front desk insisted on handling the issue herself rather than getting the manager.

36154,1062,34168,2023-04-21,"I didn't realize it when I booked but this hotel is pretty old. That's okay, but it definitely needs some TLC. For example, my A/C unit looked like it was about on its last legs, and my closet doors were bent, misaligned and off track, and I couldn't get them back on. The furnishings also just have kind of a dated appearance and are just generally worn from years of use.

Again, not a total dealbreaker but the hotel is just not in as good of condition as most others I've stayed in recently. It was clean, though.

I booked a ""premium"" room with a view and the view was actually pretty decent. I was on the highest floor of the hotel and my view was of the lake, with Universal's Volcano Island behind it. I can't really complain there. Of course it's really just a view of other hotels, a man-made lake and a theme park in the distance, but it was better than looking at the parking lot like in a lot of inexpensive hotels. The room was pretty reasonably priced.

The hotel was pretty busy and has a feel of what would have been a resort-style hotel when it was built, I'm guessing in the 80's. I wasn't really looking for that, honestly, but I can't fault the hotel for the fact that I didn't know what to expect. It's a busy, touristy area and the hotel caters to that.
